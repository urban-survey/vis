      "abstractNote": "Systems biologists use interaction graphs to model the behavior of biological systems at the molecular level. In an iterative process, such biologists obser ve the reactions of living cells under various experimental conditions, view the results in the context of the interaction graph, and then propose changes to the graph model. These graphs ser ve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incor porates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations betweeBan experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaboratorsweconcludethat Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model. &#xD;",

The output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that clustering gene expression data groups together efficiently genes of known similar function, and we find a similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications of the status of cellular processes. Also, coexpression of genes of known function with poorly characterized or novel genes may provide a simple means of gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which information is not available currently.",

      "abstractNote": "This is a survey on graph visualization and navigation techniques, as used in information visualization. Graphs appear in numerous applications such as web browsing, state-transition diagrams, and data structures. The ability to visualize and to navigate in these potentially large, abstract graphs is often a crucial part of an application. Information visualization has specific requirements, which means that this survey approaches the results of traditional graph drawing from a different perspective.",

      "abstractNote": "The research activity in bio-informatics has now reached a new phase, called post-genomics. It aims at the description of gene products as part of global processes in cells. In this research area, the various tasks to be conducted by biologists call for methods inspired from knowledge extraction and representation, and from information visualization. We describe a system devoted to the visualization of metabolic pathways. This set of biological reactions describe product transformations in the cell. The analysis of various pathway visualization tools led us to qualitative assertions. First, it is essential that the visualization environment preserves the drawing conventions borrowed from biology. Second, it seems important to offer an environment in which the user can navigate while preserving cognitive continuity. Our system focuses on these interactive and navigational issues. It offers mechanisms such as interactive color mapping and semantic zooming of pathways through various levels of details. Our tool also aims at helping biologists in the analysis of experimental results measuring gene expression in various biological processes. Although our efforts have focused on the visualization of metabolic pathways, our system should help to visualize, analyze and discover other types of biological pathways (e.g. regulatory pathways).",

      "abstractNote": "The EcoCyc system consists of a knowledge base that describes the genes and intermediary metabolism of E. coli, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for accessing that knowledge. This paper presents algorithms for drawing metabolic pathways by dynamically querying the underlying knowledge base. These algorithms provide a foundation for building graphical user interfaces to metabolic databases. Pathway drawing is a graph-layout problem. Our algorithms draw pathways of several different topologies, including linear, cyclic, and branching pathways, as well as larger groupings of such pathways. The algorithms provide several visual presentations of metabolic pathways, for example, compounds can be drawn as names and/or chemical structures, and enzyme names and side compounds can be drawn or omitted. The GUI also provides several facilities for navigating in the space of biochemical pathways, such as traversing connections between pathways, and exploding or collapsing a pathway to include or exclude neighboring pathways.",

      "abstractNote": "A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children",

In particular, we explore combinations of node-link and Treemap forms, to combine the space-efficiency of Treemaps with the structural clarity of node-link diagrams. A taxonomy is developed to characterize the design space of such hybrid combinations. A software prototype is described, which we used to explore various techniques for visualizing, browsing and interacting with elastic hierarchies, such as side-by-side overview and detail views, highlighting and rubber banding across views, visualization of multiple foci, and smooth animations across transitions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the characteristics of elastic hierarchies and suggestions for research on their properties and uses.",

      "abstractNote": "Biologists pioneering the new field of comparative functional genomics attempt to infer the mechanisms of gene regulation by looking for similarities and differences of gene activity over time across multiple species. They use three kinds of data: functional data such as gene activity measurements, pathway data that represent a series of reactions within a cellular process, and phylogenetic relationship data that describe the relatedness of species. No existing visualization tool can visually encode the biologically interesting relationships between multiple pathways, multiple genes, and multiple species. We tackle the challenge of visualizing all aspects of this comparative functional genomics dataset with a new interactive tool called Pathline. In addition to the overall characterization of the problem and design of Pathline, our contributions include two new visual encoding techniques. One is a new method for linearizing metabolic pathways that provides appropriate topological information and supports the comparison of quantitative data along the pathway. The second is the curvemap view, a depiction of time series data for comparison of gene activity and metabolite levels across multiple species. Pathline was developed in close collaboration with a team of genomic scientists. We validate our approach with case studies of the biologists’ use of Pathline and report on how they use the tool to confirm existing findings and to discover new scientific insights.",

      "abstractNote": "In life sciences, the importance of complex network visualization is ever increasing. Yet, existing approaches for the visualization of networks are general purpose techniques that are often not suited to support the specific needs of researchers in the life sciences, or to handle the large network sizes and specific network characteristics that are prevalent in the field. Examples for such networks are biomedical ontologies and biochemical reaction networks, which are bipartite networks � a particular graph class which is rarely addressed in visualization. Our table-based approach allows to visualize large bipartite networks alongside with a multitude of attributes and hyperlinks to biological databases. To explore complex network motifs and perform intricate selections within the visualized network data, we introduce a new script-based brushing mechanism that integrates naturally with the interlinked, tabular representation. A prototype for exploring bipartite graphs, which uses the proposed visualization and interaction techniques, is also presented and used on real data sets from the application domain.",

Their advantage is an extremely space-efficient graphical representation that does not require explicit drawing of edges. In this paper, we survey the design space for this class of visualization techniques. For that purpose, we first establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining most of the existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by an outlook to the so far unexplored regions of the design space by giving a few examples of novel combinations of design parameters. Furthermore, we ensure that our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development by discussing and presenting a concrete software implementation of the introduced design space.",

      "abstractNote": "In Toponomics, the function protein pattern in cells or tissue (the toponome) is imaged and analyzed for applications in toxicology, new drug development and patient-drug-interaction. The most advanced imaging technique is robot-driven multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy. This technique is capable of co-mapping hundreds of proteins and their distribution and assembly in protein clusters across a cell or tissue sample by running cycles of fluorescence tagging with monoclonal antibodies or other affinity reagents, imaging, and bleaching in situ. The imaging results in complex multi-parameter data composed of one slice or a 3D volume per affinity reagent. Biologists are particularly interested in the localization of co-occurring proteins, the frequency of co-occurrence and the distribution of co-occurring proteins across the cell. We present an interactive visual analysis approach for the evaluation of multi-parameter fluorescence microscopy data in toponomics. Multiple, linked views facilitate the definition of features by brushing multiple dimensions. The feature specification result is linked to all views establishing a focus+context visualization in 3D. In a new attribute view, we integrate techniques from graph visualization. Each node in the graph represents an affinity reagent while each edge represents two co-occurring affinity reagent bindings. The graph visualization is enhanced by glyphs which encode specific properties of the binding. The graph view is equipped with brushing facilities. By brushing in the spatial and attribute domain, the biologist achieves a better understanding of the function protein patterns of a cell. Furthermore, an interactive table view is integrated which summarizes unique fluorescence patterns. We discuss our approach with respect to a cell probe containing lymphocytes and a prostate tissue section.",

      "abstractNote": "To date, work in microarrays, sequenced genomes, and bioinformatics has focused largely on algorithmic methods for processing and manipulating vast biological data sets. Future improvements will likely provide users with guidance in selecting the most appropriate algorithms and metrics for identifying meaningful clusters--interesting patterns in large data sets, such asgroups of genes with similar profiles. Hierarchical clustering has been shown to be effective in microarray data analysis for identifying genes with similar profiles and thus possibly with similarfunctions. Users also need an efficient visualization tool, however, to facilitate pattern extraction from microarray data sets.The Hierarchical Clustering Explorer integrates four interactive features to provide information visualization techniques that allow users to control the processes and interact with the results. Thus, hybrid approaches that combine powerful algorithms with interactive visualization tools will join the strengths of fast processors with the detailed understanding of domain experts.",

      "abstractNote": "A standard approach for visualizing multivariate networks is to use one or more multidimensional views (for example, scatterplots) for selecting nodes by various metrics, possibly coordinated with a node-link view of the network. In this paper, we present three novel approaches for achieving a tighter integration of these views through hybrid techniques for multidimensional visualization, graph selection and layout. First, we present the FlowVizMenu, a radial menu containing a scatterplot that can be popped up transiently and manipulated with rapid, fluid gestures to select and modify the axes of its scatterplot. Second, the FlowVizMenu can be used to steer an attribute-driven layout of the network, causing certain nodes of a node-link diagram to move toward their corresponding positions in a scatterplot while others can be positioned manually or by force-directed layout. Third, we describe a novel hybrid approach that combines a scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) and parallel coordinates called the Parallel Scatterplot Matrix (P-SPLOM), which can be used to visualize and select features within the network. We also describe a novel arrangement of scatterplots called the Scatterplot Staircase (SPLOS) that requires less space than a traditional scatterplot matrix. Initial user feedback is reported.",

      "abstractNote": "While many data sets contain multiple relationships, depicting more than one data relationship within a single visualization is challenging. We introduce Bubble Sets as a visualization technique for data that has both a primary data relation with a semantically significant spatial organization and a significant set membership relation in which members of the same set are not necessarily adjacent in the primary layout. In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds. Case studies show how this technique can be used to indicate multiple sets on a variety of common visualizations.",

      "abstractNote": "Social networks collected by historians or sociologists typically have a large number of actors and edge attributes. Applying social network analysis (SNA) algorithms to these networks produces additional attributes such as degree, centrality, and clustering coefficients. Understanding the effects of this plethora of attributes is one of the main challenges of multivariate SNA. We present the design of GraphDice, a multivariate network visualization system for exploring the attribute space of edges and actors. GraphDice builds upon the ScatterDice system for its main multidimensional navigation paradigm, and extends it with novel mechanisms to support network exploration in general and SNA tasks in particular. Novel mechanisms include visualization of attributes of interval type and projection of numerical edge attributes to node attributes. We show how these extensions to the original ScatterDice system allow to support complex visual analysis tasks on networks with hundreds of actors and up to 30 attributes, while providing a simple and consistent interface for interacting with network data.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, we describe a taxonomy of generic graph related tasks along with a computer-based evaluation designed to assess the readability of two representations of graphs: matrix-based representations and node-link diagrams. This evaluation encompasses seven generic tasks and leads to insightful recommendations for the representation of graphs according to their size and density. Typically, we show that when graphs are bigger than twenty vertices, the matrix-based visualization outperforms node-link diagrams on most tasks. Only path finding is consistently in favor of node-link diagrams throughout the evaluation.",

      "abstractNote": "Most graph visualization techniques focus on the structure of graphs and do not offer support for dealing with node attributes and edge labels. To enable users to detect relations and patterns in terms of data associated with nodes and edges, we present a technique where this data plays a more central role. Nodes and edges are clustered based on associated data. Via direct manipulation users can interactively inspect and query the graph. Questions that can be answered include, “which edge types are activated by specific node attributes?” and, “how and from where can I reach specific types of nodes?” To validate our approach we contrast it with current practice. We also provide several examples where our method was used to study transition graphs that model real-world systems.",

      "abstractNote": "Abstract Graphs depicted as node-link diagrams are widely used to show relationships between entities. However, nodelink diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edge bundling remedies this and reveals high-level edge patterns. Previous methods require the graph to contain a hierarchy for this, or they construct a control mesh to guide the edge bundling process, which often results in bundles that show considerable variation in curvature along the overall bundle direction. We present a new edge bundling method that uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. In contrast to previous methods, no hierarchy is used and no control mesh. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow. Finally, we present a rendering technique that can be used to emphasize the bundling.",

      "abstractNote": "Summary: Cytoscape is a popular bioinformatics package for biological network visualization and data integration. Version 2.8 introduces two powerful new features—Custom Node Graphics and Attribute Equations—which can be used jointly to greatly enhance Cytoscape's data integration and visualization capabilities. Custom Node Graphics allow an image to be projected onto a node, including images generated dynamically or at remote locations. Attribute Equations provide Cytoscape with spreadsheet-like functionality in which the value of an attribute is computed dynamically as a function of other attributes and network properties.\nAvailability and implementation: Cytoscape is a desktop Java application released under the Library Gnu Public License (LGPL). Binary install bundles and source code for Cytoscape 2.8 are available for download from http://cytoscape.org.\nContact: msmoot@ucsd.edu",

      "abstractNote": "We present a novel technique-Compressed Adjacency Matrices-for visualizing gene regulatory networks. These directed networks have strong structural characteristics: out-degrees with a scale-free distribution, in-degrees bound by a low maximum, and few and small cycles. Standard visualization techniques, such as node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, are impeded by these network characteristics. The scale-free distribution of out-degrees causes a high number of intersecting edges in node-link diagrams. Adjacency matrices become space-inefficient due to the low in-degrees and the resulting sparse network. Compressed adjacency matrices, however, exploit these structural characteristics. By cutting open and rearranging an adjacency matrix, we achieve a compact and neatly-arranged visualization. Compressed adjacency matrices allow for easy detection of subnetworks with a specific structure, so-called motifs, which provide important knowledge about gene regulatory networks to domain experts. We summarize motifs commonly referred to in the literature, and relate them to network analysis tasks common to the visualization domain. We show that a user can easily find the important motifs in compressed adjacency matrices, and that this is hard in standard adjacency matrix and node-link diagrams. We also demonstrate that interaction techniques for standard adjacency matrices can be used for our compressed variant. These techniques include rearrangement clustering, highlighting, and filtering.",

      "abstractNote": "We present the zoomable adjacency matrix explorer (ZAME), a visualization tool for exploring graphs at a scale of millions of nodes and edges. ZAME is based on an adjacency matrix graph representation aggregated at multiple scales. It allows analysts to explore a graph at many levels, zooming and panning with interactive performance from an overview to the most detailed views. Several components work together in the ZAME tool to make this possible. Efficient matrix ordering algorithms group related elements. Individual data cases are aggregated into higher-order meta-representations. Aggregates are arranged into a pyramid hierarchy that allows for on-demand paging to GPU shader programs to support smooth multiscale browsing. Using ZAME, we are able to explore the entire French Wikipedia - over 500,000 articles and 6,000,000 links - with interactive performance on standard consumer-level computer hardware.",

The graph visualized with our technique may have edges that are weighted and/or directed. We first explore the design space of visualizations of compound graphs and present a taxonomy of hybrid visualization techniques. We then present our prototype, which allows clusters (i.e. subtrees) of nodes to be grouped into matrices or split apart using a radial menu. We also demonstrate how our prototype can be used in the software engineering domain, and compare it to the commercial matrix-based visualization tool Lattix using a qualitative user study.",

      "abstractNote": "The Seesoft software visualization system allows one to analyze up to 50000 lines of code simultaneously by mapping each line of code into a thin row. The color of each row indicates a statistic of interest, e.g., red rows are those most recently changed, and blue are those least recently changed. Seesoft displays data derived from a variety of sources, such as version control systems that track the age, programmer, and purpose of the code (e.g., control ISDN lamps, fix bug in call forwarding); static analyses, (e.g., locations where functions are called); and dynamic analyses (e.g., profiling). By means of direct manipulation and high interaction graphics, the user can manipulate this reduced representation of the code in order to find interesting patterns. Further insight is obtained by using additional windows to display the actual code. Potential applications for Seesoft include discovery, project management, code tuning, and analysis of development methodologies",

      "abstractNote": "This paper introduces PivotGraph, a software tool that uses a new technique for visualizing and analyzing graph structures. The technique is designed specifically for graphs that are \"multivariate,\" i.e., where each node is associated with several attributes. Unlike visualizations which emphasize global graph topology, PivotGraph uses a simple grid-based approach to focus on the relationship between node attributes and connections. The interaction technique is derived from an analogy with methods seen in spreadsheet pivot tables and in online analytical processing (OLAP). Finally, several examples are presented in which PivotGraph was applied to real-world data sets.",

The goal of this work is to extend the understanding of tradeoffs and best practices for the representation of edges in directed graphs and to help practitioners choose among different options. Our work applies to graphs in which directed links are depicted using lines connecting the nodes. We tested five different edge representations chosen carefully based on user feedback to thoroughly cover the directed-edge design space. We also investigated how the use of pattern compression affects performance and subjective user preference. The article presents detailed results regarding the significant performance and preference differences between directed-edge representations and provides practical recommendations on their use.",

      "abstractNote": "Social network analysis (SNA) is becoming increasingly concerned not only with actors and their relations, but also with distinguishing between different types of such entities. For example, social scientists may want to investigate asymmetric relations in organizations with strict chains of command, or incorporate non-actors such as conferences and projects when analyzing coauthorship patterns. Multimodal social networks are those where actors and relations belong to different types, or modes, and multimodal social network analysis (mSNA) is accordingly SNA for such networks. In this paper, we present a design study that we conducted with several social scientist collaborators on how to support mSNA using visual analytics tools. Based on an openended, formative design process, we devised a visual representation called parallel node-link bands (PNLBs) that splits modes into separate bands and renders connections between adjacent ones, similar to the list view in Jigsaw. We then used the tool in a qualitative evaluation involving five social scientists whose feedback informed a second design phase that incorporated additional network metrics. Finally, we conducted a second qualitative evaluation with our social scientist collaborators that provided further insights on the utility of the PNLBs representation and the potential of visual analytics for mSNA.",

      "abstractNote": "Pathway maps are an important source of information when analyzing functional implications of experimental data on biological processes. However, associating large quantities of data with nodes on a pathway map and allowing in depth-analysis at the same time is a challenging task. While a wide variety of approaches for doing so exist, they either do not scale beyond a few experiments or fail to represent the pathway appropriately. To remedy this, we introduce enRoute, a new approach for interactively exploring experimental data along paths that are dynamically extracted from pathways. By showing an extracted path side-by-side with experimental data, enRoute can present large amounts of data for every pathway node. It can visualize hundreds of samples, dozens of experimental conditions, and even multiple datasets capturing different aspects of a node at the same time. Another important property of this approach is its conceptual compatibility with arbitrary forms of pathways. Most notably, enRoute works well with pathways that are manually created, as they are available in large, public pathway databases. We demonstrate enRoute with pathways from the well-established KEGG database and expression as well as copy number datasets from humans and mice with more than 1,000 experiments. We validate enRoute using case studies with domain experts, who used enRoute to explore data for glioblastoma multiforme in humans and a model of steatohepatitis in mice.",

We identify five such strategies #x2014;called CVV design patterns #x2014;based on an extensive review of the literature in composite visualization. We go on to show how these design patterns can all be expressed in terms of a design space describing the correlation between two visualizations in terms of spatial mapping as well as the data relationships between items in the visualizations. We also discuss how to use this design space to suggest potential directions for future research.",

      "abstractNote": "GeneaQuilts is a new visualization technique for representing large genealogies of up to several thousand individuals. The visualization takes the form of a diagonally-filled matrix, where rows are individuals and columns are nuclear families. After identifying the major tasks performed in genealogical research and the limits of current software, we present an interactive genealogy exploration system based on GeneaQuilts. The system includes an overview, a timeline, search and filtering components, and a new interaction technique called Bring & Slide that allows fluid navigation in very large genealogies. We report on preliminary feedback from domain experts and show how our system supports a number of their tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the set's elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.",

      "abstractNote": "We present an assessment of the state and historic development of evaluation practices as reported in papers published at the IEEE Visualization conference. Our goal is to reflect on a meta-level about evaluation in our community through a systematic understanding of the characteristics and goals of presented evaluations. For this purpose we conducted a systematic review of ten years of evaluations in the published papers using and extending a coding scheme previously established by Lam et al. [2012]. The results of our review include an overview of the most common evaluation goals in the community, how they evolved over time, and how they contrast or align to those of the IEEE Information Visualization conference. In particular, we found that evaluations specific to assessing resulting images and algorithm performance are the most prevalent (with consistently 80-90% of all papers since 1997). However, especially over the last six years there is a steady increase in evaluation methods that include participants, either by evaluating their performances and subjective feedback or by evaluating their work practices and their improved analysis and reasoning capabilities using visual tools. Up to 2010, this trend in the IEEE Visualization conference was much more pronounced than in the IEEE Information Visualization conference which only showed an increasing percentage of evaluation through user performance and experience testing. Since 2011, however, also papers in IEEE Information Visualization show such an increase of evaluations of work practices and analysis as well as reasoning using visual tools. Further, we found that generally the studies reporting requirements analyses and domain-specific work practices are too informally reported which hinders cross-comparison and lowers external validity.",

Guided by ethnographic research of these online communities, we have designed and implemented a visualization system for playful end-user exploration and navigation of large scale online social networks. Our design builds upon familiar node link network layouts to contribute customized techniques for exploring connectivity in large graph structures, supporting visual search and analysis, and automatically identifying and visualizing community structures. Both public installation and controlled studies of the system provide evidence of the system's usability, capacity for facilitating discovery, and potential for fun and engaged social activity",

We present a new method for visualizing such compound graphs. Our approach is based on visually bundling the adjacency edges, i.e., non-hierarchical edges, together. We realize this as follows. We assume that the hierarchy is shown via a standard tree visualization method. Next, we bend each adjacency edge, modeled as a B-spline curve, toward the polyline defined by the path via the inclusion edges from one node to another. This hierarchical bundling reduces visual clutter and also visualizes implicit adjacency edges between parent nodes that are the result of explicit adjacency edges between their respective child nodes. Furthermore, hierarchical edge bundling is a generic method which can be used in conjunction with existing tree visualization techniques. We illustrate our technique by providing example visualizations and discuss the results based on an informal evaluation provided by potential users of such visualizations.",

      "abstractNote": "In the field of comparative genomics, scientists seek to answerquestions about evolution and genomic function by comparing thegenomes of species to find regions of shared sequences. Conservedsyntenic blocks are an important biological data abstraction for indicating regions of shared sequences. The goal of this work is to show multiple types of relationships at multiple scales in a way thatis visually comprehensible in accordance with known perceptual principles. We present a task analysis for this domain where thefundamental questions asked by biologists can be understood by a characterization of relationships into the four types of proximity/location, size, orientation, and similarity/strength, andthe four scales of genome, chromosome, block, and genomic feature. We also propose a new taxonomy of the design space for visually encoding conservation data. We present MizBee, a multiscale synteny browser with the unique property of providing interactive side-by-side views of the data across the range of scales supporting exploration of all of these relationship types. We conclude with case studies from two biologists who used MizBee to augment their previous automatic analysis work flow, providing anecdotal evidence about the efficacy ofthe system for the visualization of syntenic data, the analysis of conservation relationships, and the communication of scientific insights.",

      "abstractNote": "Jointly analyzing biological pathway maps and experimental data is critical for understanding how biological processes work in different conditions and why different samples exhibit certain characteristics. This joint analysis, however, poses a significant challenge for visualization. Current techniques are either well suited to visualize large amounts of pathway node attributes, or to represent the topology of the pathway well, but do not accomplish both at the same time. To address this we introduce enRoute, a technique that enables analysts to specify a path of interest in a pathway, extract this path into a separate, linked view, and show detailed experimental data associated with the nodes of this extracted path right next to it. This juxtaposition of the extracted path and the experimental data allows analysts to simultaneously investigate large amounts of potentially heterogeneous data, thereby solving the problem of joint analysis of topology and node attributes. As this approach does not modify the layout of pathway maps, it is compatible with arbitrary graph layouts, including those of hand-crafted, image-based pathway maps. We demonstrate the technique in context of pathways from the KEGG and the Wikipathways databases. We apply experimental data from two public databases, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) that both contain a wide variety of genomic datasets for a large number of samples. In addition, we make use of a smaller dataset of hepatocellular carcinoma and common xenograft models. To verify the utility of enRoute, domain experts conducted two case studies where they explore data from the CCLE and the hepatocellular carcinoma datasets in the context of relevant pathways.",

Yet, tasks are a multi-faceted concept and it is thus not surprising that the many existing task taxonomies and models all describe different aspects of tasks, depending on what these task descriptions aim to capture. This results in a clear need to bring these different aspects together under the common hood of a general design space of visualization tasks, which we propose in this paper. Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions. We exemplify its concrete use by applying our design space in the domain of climate impact research. To this end, we propose interfaces to our design space for different user roles (developers, authors, and end users) that allow users of different levels of expertise to work with it.",

      "abstractNote": "We created a visualization tool, called Circos, to facilitate the identification and analysis of similarities and differences arising from comparisons of genomes. Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors and text.",

Social networks are locally dense, which makes node-link displays unreadable. Yet, main analysis tasks require following paths, which is difficult on matrices. This article presents MatLink, a hybrid representation with links overlaid on the borders of a matrix and dynamic topological feedback as the pointer moves. We evaluated MatLink by an experiment comparing its readability, in term of errors and time, for social network-related tasks to the other conventional representations on graphs varying in size (small and medium) and density. It showed significant advantages for most tasks, especially path-related ones where standard matrices are weak.",

      "abstractNote": "Network data is ubiquitous; e-mail traffic between persons, telecommunication, transport and financial networks are some examples. Often these networks are large and multivariate, besides the topological structure of the network, multivariate data on the nodes and links is available. Currently, exploration and analysis methods are focused on a single aspect; the network topology or the multivariate data. In addition, tools and techniques are highly domain specific and require expert knowledge. We focus on the non-expert user and propose a novel solution for multivariate network exploration and analysis that tightly couples structural and multivariate analysis. In short, we go from Detail to Overview via Selections and Aggregations (DOSA): users are enabled to gain insights through the creation of selections of interest (manually or automatically), and producing high-level, infographic-style overviews simultaneously. Finally, we present example explorations on real-world datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the exploration and understanding of multivariate networks where presentation of findings comes for free.",

      "abstractNote": "The field of graph visualization has produced a wealth of visualization techniques for accomplishing a variety of analysis tasks. Therefore analysts often rely on a suite of different techniques, and visual graph analysis application builders strive to provide this breadth of techniques. To provide a holistic model for specifying network visualization techniques (as opposed to considering each technique in isolation) we present the Graph-Level Operations (GLO) model. We describe a method for identifying GLOs and apply it to identify five classes of GLOs, which can be flexibly combined to re-create six canonical graph visualization techniques. We discuss advantages of the GLO model, including potentially discovering new, effective network visualization techniques and easing the engineering challenges of building multi-technique graph visualization applications. Finally, we implement the GLOs that we identified into the GLO-STIX prototype system that enables an analyst to interactively explore a graph by applying GLOs.",

      "abstractNote": "We introduce Sashimi plots, a quantitative multi-sample visualization of mRNA sequencing reads aligned to gene annotations. Sashimi plots are made using alignments (stored in the SAM/BAM format) and gene model annotations (in GFF format), which can be custom-made by the user or obtained from databases such as Ensembl or UCSC. We describe two implementations of Sashimi plots: (1) a stand-alone command line implementation aimed at making customizable publication quality figures, and (2) an implementation built into the Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) browser, which enables rapid and dynamic creation of Sashimi plots for any genomic region of interest, suitable for exploratory analysis of alternatively spliced regions of the transcriptome. Isoform expression estimates outputted by the MISO program can be optionally plotted along with Sashimi plots. Sashimi plots can be used to quickly screen differentially spliced exons along genomic regions of interest and can be used in publication quality figures. The Sashimi plot software and documentation is available from: http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/miso/docs/sashimi.html",

      "abstractNote": "Many types of cancers are known to have subtypes that derive from common biomolecular alterations. Identifying and characterizing these subtypes is important, since knowledge about the alterations in these subtypes can have serious implications on the treatment and prognosis of patients. The lack of appropriate tools, however, makes the complex process of analyzing subtypes a tedious endeavor. We present StratomeX, an application that supports analysts in identifying and characterizing cancer subtypes using interactive visualizations. StratomeX was first published at EuroVis 2012, but we expect that the BioVis community can benefit from learning about this extensible open source system.",

A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results.  We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.",

      "abstractNote": "Bibliographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploring large network datasets, such as scientific collaboration networks, is challenging because they often contain a large number of nodes and edges in several types and with multiple attributes. Analyses of such networks are often long and complex, and may require several sessions by multiple users. Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users' interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a novel visual exploration method based on small multiples and large singles for effective and efficient data analysis. Users are enabled to explore the state space by offering multiple alternatives from the current state. Users can then select the alternative of choice and continue the analysis. Furthermore, the intermediate steps in the exploration process are preserved and can be revisited and adapted using an intuitive navigation mechanism based on the well-known undo-redo stack and filmstrip metaphor. As proof of concept the exploration method is implemented in a prototype. The effectiveness of the exploration method is tested using a formal user study comparing four different interaction methods. By using Small Multiples as data exploration method users need fewer steps in answering questions and also explore a significantly larger part of the state space in the same amount of time, providing them with a broader perspective on the data, hence lowering the chance of missing important features. Also, users prefer visual exploration with small multiples over non-small multiple variants.",

As the number of documents and the corresponding number of concepts and entities within the documents grow larger, sense-making processes become more and more difficult for the analysts. We have developed a visual analytic system called Jigsaw that represents documents and their entities visually in order to help analysts examine them more efficiently and develop theories about potential actions more quickly. Jigsaw provides multiple coordinated views of document entities with a special emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities across the different documents.",

      "abstractNote": "Several previous systems allow users to interactively explore a large input graph through cuts of a superimposed hierarchy. This hierarchy is often created using clustering algorithms or topological features present in the graph. However, many graphs have domain-specific attributes associated with the nodes and edges, which could be used to create many possible hierarchies providing unique views of the input graph. GrouseFlocks is a system for the exploration of this graph hierarchy space. By allowing users to see several different possible hierarchies on the same graph, the system helps users investigate graph hierarchy space instead of a single fixed hierarchy. GrouseFlocks provides a simple set of operations so that users can create and modify their graph hierarchies based on selections. These selections can be made manually or based on patterns in the attribute data provided with the graph. It provides feedback to the user within seconds, allowing interactive exploration of this space.",

      "abstractNote": "The analysis of paths in graphs is highly relevant in many domains. Typically, path-related tasks are performed in node-link layouts. Unfortunately, graph layouts often do not scale to the size of many real world networks. Also, many networks are multivariate, i.e., contain rich attribute sets associated with the nodes and edges. These attributes are often critical in judging paths, but directly visualizing attributes in a graph layout exacerbates the scalability problem. In this paper, we present visual analysis solutions dedicated to path-related tasks in large and highly multivariate graphs. We show that by focusing on paths, we can address the scalability problem of multivariate graph visualization, equipping analysts with a powerful tool to explore large graphs. We introduce Pathfinder, a technique that provides visual methods to query paths, while considering various constraints. The resulting set of paths is visualized in both a ranked list and as a node-link diagram. For the paths in the list, we display rich attribute data associated with nodes and edges, and the node-link diagram provides topological context. The paths can be ranked based on topological properties, such as path length or average node degree, and scores derived from attribute data. Pathfinder is designed to scale to graphs with tens of thousands of nodes and edges by employing strategies such as incremental query results. We demonstrate Pathfinder's fitness for use in scenarios with data from a coauthor network and biological pathways.",

The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive list of reordering algorithms published in different fields such as statistics, bioinformatics, or graph theory. While several of these algorithms are described in publications and others are available in software libraries and programs, there is little awareness of what is done across all fields. Our survey aims at describing these reordering algorithms in a unified manner to enable a wide audience to understand their differences and subtleties. We organize this corpus in a consistent manner, independently of the application or research field. We also provide practical guidance on how to select appropriate algorithms depending on the structure and size of the matrix to reorder, and point to implementations when available.",

In BLC, both nodes and edges maintain \"deep links\" to the exact source phrases and sections in associated documents. In our control condition, we were able to reproduce previously described spatial organization behaviors using document windows on the large display.

      "abstractNote": "A major challenge in data-driven biomedical research lies in the collection and representation of data provenance information to ensure that findings are reproducibile. In order to communicate and reproduce multi-step analysis workflows executed on datasets that contain data for dozens or hundreds of samples, it is crucial to be able to visualize the provenance graph at different levels of aggregation. Most existing approaches are based on node-link diagrams, which do not scale to the complexity of typical data provenance graphs. In our proposed approach, we reduce the complexity of the graph using hierarchical and motif-based aggregation. Based on user action and graph attributes, a modular degree-of-interest (DoI) function is applied to expand parts of the graph that are relevant to the user. This interest-driven adaptive approach to provenance visualization allows users to review and communicate complex multi-step analyses, which can be based on hundreds of files that are processed by numerous workflows. We have integrated our approach into an analysis platform that captures extensive data provenance information, and demonstrate its effectiveness by means of a biomedical usage scenario.",

This kind of data alone implies a challenge for its visualization as it is hard to avoid clutter of network elements if using traditional node-link diagrams. Moreover, real-life network data sets usually represent objects with a large number of additional attributes that need to be visualized, such as in software engineering, social network analysis, or biochemistry. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called Network Lens, to visualize such attributes in context of the underlying network.

      "abstractNote": "Analyzing large, multivariate graphs is an important problem in many domains, yet such graphs are challenging to visualize. In this paper, we introduce a novel, scalable, tree+table multivariate graph visualization technique, which makes many tasks related to multivariate graph analysis easier to achieve. The core principle we follow is to selectively query for nodes or subgraphs of interest and visualize these subgraphs as a spanning tree of the graph. The tree is laid out in a linear layout, which enables us to juxtapose the nodes with a table visualization where diverse attributes can be shown. We also use this table as an adjacency matrix, so that the resulting technique is a hybrid node-link/adjacency matrix technique. We implement this concept in Juniper, and complement it with a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to dynamically grow, re-structure, and aggregate the tree, as well as change the layout or show paths between nodes. We demonstrate the utility of our tool in usage scenarios for different multivariate networks: a bipartite network of scholars, papers, and citation metrics, and a multitype network of story characters, places, books, etc.",

      "abstractNote": "Finding patterns in graphs has become a vital challenge in many domains from biological systems, network security, to finance (e.g., finding money laundering rings of bankers and business owners). While there is significant interest in graph databases and querying techniques, less research has focused on helping analysts make sense of underlying patterns within a group of subgraph results. Visualizing graph query results is challenging, requiring effective summarization of a large number of subgraphs, each having potentially shared node-values, rich node features, and flexible structure across queries. We present VIGOR, a novel interactive visual analytics system, for exploring and making sense of query results. VIGOR uses multiple coordinated views, leveraging different data representations and organizations to streamline analysts sensemaking process. VIGOR contributes: (1) an exemplar-based interaction technique, where an analyst starts with a specific result and relaxes constraints to find other similar results or starts with only the structure (i.e., without node value constraints), and adds constraints to narrow in on specific results; and (2) a novel feature-aware subgraph result summarization. Through a collaboration with Symantec, we demonstrate how VIGOR helps tackle real-world problems through the discovery of security blindspots in a cybersecurity dataset with over 11,000 incidents. We also evaluate VIGOR with a within-subjects study, demonstrating VIGOR's ease of use over a leading graph database management system, and its ability to help analysts understand their results at higher speed and make fewer errors.",

      "abstractNote": "Large scale semantic graphs such as social networks and knowledge graphs contain rich and useful information. However, due to combined challenges in scale, density, and heterogeneity, it is impractical for users to answer many interesting questions by visual inspection alone. This is because even a semantically simple question, such as which of my extended friends are also fans of my favorite band, can in fact require information from a non-trivial number of nodes to answer. In this paper, we propose a method that combines graph browsing with query to overcome the limitation of visual inspection. By using query as the main way for information discovery in graph exploration, our “query, expand, and query again” model enables users to probe beyond the visible part of the graph and only bring in the interesting nodes, leaving the view clutter-free. We have implemented a prototype called GraphCharter and demonstrated its effectiveness and usability in a case study and a user study on Freebase knowledge graph with millions of nodes and edges.",

We conducted two quantitative user studies to evaluate different visual representations for such dense many-to-many flows. In our first study we compared a bundled node-link flow map representation and OD Maps [37] with a new visualisation we call MapTrix. Like OD Maps, MapTrix overcomes the clutter associated with a traditional flow map while providing geographic embedding that is missing in standard OD matrix representations. We found that OD Maps and MapTrix had similar performance while bundled node-link flow map representations did not scale at all well. Our second study compared participant performance with OD Maps and MapTrix on larger data sets. Again performance was remarkably similar.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph and tree visualization techniques enable interactive exploration of complex relations while communicating topology. However, most existing techniques have not been designed for situations where visual information such as images is also present at each node and must be displayed. This paper presents MoireGraphs to address this need. MoireGraphs combine a new focus+context radial graph layout with a suite of interaction techniques (focus strength changing, radial rotation, level highlighting, secondary foci, animated transitions and node information) to assist in the exploration of graphs with visual nodes. The method is scalable to hundreds of displayed visual nodes.",

      "abstractNote": "Storing analytical provenance generates a knowledge base with a large potential for recalling previous results and guiding users in future analyses. However, without extensive manual creation of meta information and annotations by the users, search and retrieval of analysis states can become tedious. We present KnowledgePearls, a solution for efﬁcient retrieval of analysis states that are structured as provenance graphs containing automatically recorded user interactions and visualizations. As a core component, we describe a visual interface for querying and exploring analysis states based on their similarity to a partial deﬁnition of a requested analysis state. Depending on the use case, this deﬁnition may be provided explicitly by the user by formulating a search query or inferred from given reference states. We explain our approach using the example of efﬁcient retrieval of demographic analyses by Hans Rosling and discuss our implementation for a fast look-up of previous states. Our approach is independent of the underlying visualization framework. We discuss the applicability for visualizations which are based on the declarative grammar Vega and we use a Vega-based implementation of Gapminder as guiding example. We additionally present a biomedical case study to illustrate how KnowledgePearls facilitates the exploration process by recalling states from earlier analyses.",

      "abstractNote": "The digital humanities have experienced tremendous growth within the last decade, mostly in the context of developing computational tools that support what is called distant reading - collecting and analyzing huge amounts of textual data for synoptic evaluation. On the other end of the spectrum is a practice at the heart of the traditional humanities, close reading - the careful, in-depth analysis of a single text in order to extract, engage, and even generate as much productive meaning as possible. The true value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive impact technology can have on poetry scholarship. Finally, we also contribute a reflection on the challenges we faced conducting visualization research in literary studies.",

We report the results of a study comparing the effectiveness of the two primary techniques for showing network data: node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices. Specifically, an evaluation with a large number of online participants revealed statistically significant differences between the two visualizations. Our work adds to existing research in several ways. First, we explore a broad spectrum of network tasks, many of which had not been previously evaluated. Second, our study uses two large datasets, typical of many real-life networks not explored by previous studies. Third, we leverage crowdsourcing to evaluate many tasks with many participants. This paper is an expanded journal version of a Graph Drawing (GD'17) conference paper. We evaluated a second dataset, added a qualitative feedback section, and expanded the procedure, results, discussion, and limitations sections.",

      "abstractNote": "We explore the effects of selecting alternative layouts in hierarchical displays that show multiple aspects of large multivariate datasets, including spatial and temporal characteristics. Hierarchical displays of this type condition a dataset by multiple discrete variable values, creating nested graphical summaries of the resulting subsets in which size, shape and colour can be used to show subset properties. These 'small multiples' are ordered by the conditioning variable values and are laid out hierarchically using dimensional stacking. Crucially, we consider the use of different layouts at different hierarchical levels, so that the coordinates of the plane can be used more effectively to draw attention to trends and anomalies in the data. We argue that these layouts should be informed by the type of conditioning variable and by the research question being explored. We focus on space-filling rectangular layouts that provide data-dense and rich overviews of data to address research questions posed in our exploratory analysis of spatial and temporal aspects of property sales in London. We develop a notation ('HiVE') that describes visualisation and layout states and provides reconfiguration operators, demonstrate its use for reconfiguring layouts to pursue research questions and provide guidelines for this process. We demonstrate how layouts can be related through animated transitions to reduce the cognitive load associated with their reconfiguration whilst supporting the exploratory process.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we introduce a new method, GraphScape, to visualize multivariate networks, i.e., graphs with multivariate data associated with their nodes. GraphScape adopts a landscape metaphor with network structure displayed on a 2D plane and the surface height in the third dimension represents node attribute. More than one attribute can be visualized simultaneously by using multiple surfaces. In addition, GraphScape can be easily combined with existing methods to further increase the total number of attributes visualized. One of the major goals of GraphScape is to reveal multivariate graph clustering, which is based on both network structure and node attributes. This is achieved by a new layout algorithm and an innovative way of constructing attribute surface, which also allows visual clustering at different scales through interaction. A simplified attribute surface model is also proposed to reduce computation requirement when visualizing large networks. GraphScape is applied to networks of three different size (20, 100, and 1500) to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

      "abstractNote": "Adjacency matrices or DSMs (design structure matrices) and node-link diagrams are both visual representations of graphs, which are a common form of data in many disciplines. DSMs are used throughout the engineering community for various applications, such as process modelling or change prediction. However, outside this community, DSMs (and other matrix-based representations of graphs) are rarely applied and node-link diagrams are very popular. This paper will examine, which representation is more suitable for visualising graphs. For this purpose, several user experiments were conducted that aimed to answer this research question in the context of product models used, for example in engineering, but the results can be generalised to other applications. These experiments identify key factors on the readability of graph visualisations and confirm work on comparisons of different representations. This study widens the scope of readability comparisons between node-link and matrix-based representations by introducing new user tasks and replacing simulated, undirected graphs with directed ones employing real-world semantics.",

Speciﬁcally, an evaluation with a large number of online participants revealed statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two visualizations. Our work adds to existing research in several ways. First, we explore a broad spectrum of network tasks, many of which had not been previously evaluated. Second, our study uses a large dataset, typical of many real-life networks not explored by previous studies. Third, we leverage crowdsourcing to evaluate many tasks with many participants.",

Given an interaction network and subcellular localization annotation, Cerebral automatically generates a view of the network in the style of traditional pathway diagrams, providing an intuitive interface for the exploration of a biological pathway or system. The molecules are separated into layers according to their subcellular localization. Potential products or outcomes of the pathway can be shown at the bottom of the view, clustered according to any molecular attribute data—protein function—for example. Cerebral scales well to networks containing thousands of nodes.",

First, we present quantitative results and statistical analyses of data from an online study in which approximately 800 subjects performed 10 types of group and network tasks in the four evaluated visualizations. Specifically, we show that BubbleSets is the best alternative for tasks involving group membership assessment; that visually encoding group information over basic node-link diagrams incurs an accuracy penalty of about 25 percent in solving network tasks; and that GMap's use of prominent group labels improves memorability. We also show that GMap's visual metaphor can be slightly altered to outperform BubbleSets in group membership assessment. Second, we discuss visual characteristics that can explain the observed quantitative differences in the four visualizations and suggest design recommendations. This discussion is supported by a small scale eye-tracking study and previous results from the visualization literature. Third, we present an easily extensible user study methodology.",

      "abstractNote": "The analysis of brain connectivity is a vast ﬁeld in neuroscience with a frequent use of visual representations and an increasing need for visual analysis tools. Based on an in-depth literature review and interviews with neuroscientists, we explore high-level brain connectivity analysis tasks that need to be supported by dedicated visual analysis tools. A signiﬁcant example of such a task is the comparison of different connectivity data in the form of weighted graphs. Several approaches have been suggested for graph comparison within information visualization, but the comparison of weighted graphs has not been addressed. We explored the design space of applicable visual representations and present augmented adjacency matrix and node-link visualizations. To assess which representation best support weighted graph comparison tasks, we performed a controlled experiment. Our ﬁndings suggest that matrices support these tasks well, outperforming node-link diagrams. These results have signiﬁcant implications for the design of brain connectivity analysis tools that require weighted graph comparisons. They can also inform the design of visual analysis tools in other domains, e.g. comparison of weighted social networks or biological pathways.",

We suggest that such visualizations can be of interest not only to analysts and researchers but also to the people whose data is being analyzed. In this paper we briefly talk about two visualizations of email that we developed to give people a better sense of their email archives and social networks. One visualization shows a traditional network graph with email contacts as nodes. The second visualization depicts the temporal rhythms of interactions in dyadic relationships between ego and individual contacts. While observing and interviewing users of these systems, it became clear that, when used in tandem, these visualizations complemented and clarified each other’s depiction of a person’s social network. Based on our experience with these two systems, we propose that visualizations of social networks that are aimed at end users ought to go beyond the graph paradigm. We posit that basic cartographic principles – such as adaptive zooming and multiple viewing modes – provide system designers with useful visual solutions to the depiction of social networks.",

      "abstractNote": "The research by the information visualization community (“Info Viz”) shows clearly that using a visual representation of data-sets enables faster analysis by the end users. Several scientific reasons explain these results. First of all, the visual perception system is the most powerful of all the human perception systems. In the human brain, 70% of the receptors and 40% of the cortex are used for the vision process [27,34]. Furthermore, human beings are better at “recognition” tasks than at “memorization” tasks [10]. This implies that textual representations are less efficient than visual metaphors when one wants to analyze huge data-sets. This comes from the fact that reading is both a memorization task and a recognition task.",

Users can change their perspective on the data by rotating or decomposing the 3D cube. These manipulations can produce a range of different 2D visualizations that emphasize speciﬁc aspects of the dynamic network suited to particular analysis tasks. We describe Matrix Cubes and the interactions that can be performed on them in the Cubix system.

A wide family of cluster analysis algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering algorithms, does not provide a partition of the data set but a hierarchy of clusters organized in a binary tree, known as a dendrogram. The dendrogram has a classical node-link representation used by experts for various tasks like: to decide which subtrees are actual clusters (e.g., by cutting the dendrogram at a given depth); to give those clusters a name by inspecting their content; etc. We present Dendrogramix, a hybrid tree-matrix interactive visualization of dendrograms that superimposes the relationship between individual objects on to the hierarchy of clusters. Dendrogramix enables users to do tasks which involve both clusters and individual objects that are impracticable with the classical representation, like: to explain why a particular objects belongs to a particular cluster; to elicit and understand uncommon patterns (e.g., objects that could have been classified in a totally different cluster); etc. Those sensemaking tasks are supported by a consistent set of interaction techniques that facilitates the exploration of large clustering results.",

      "abstractNote": "For displaying a dense graph, an adjacency matrix is superior than a node-link diagram because it is more compact and free of visual clutter. A node-link diagram, however, is far better for the task of path finding because a path can be easily traced by following the corresponding links, provided that the links are not heavily crossed or tangled. We augment adjacency matrices with path visualization and associated interaction techniques to facilitate path finding. Our design is visually pleasing, and also effectively displays multiple paths based on the design commonly found in metro maps. We illustrate and assess the key aspects of our design with the results obtained from two case studies and an informal user study.",

      "abstractNote": "Graphs are typically visualized as node-link diagrams. Although there is a fair amount of research focusing on crossing minimization to improve readability, little attention has been paid on how to handle crossings when they are an essential part of the final visualizations. This requires us to understand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance. As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was conducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of crossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance. Sixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six drawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra eye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have little impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a path between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the path go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view to further confirmation in future work.",

      "abstractNote": "Graph visualizations are typically evaluated by comparing their differences in effectiveness, measured by task performance such as response time and accuracy. Such performance-based measures have proved to be useful in their own right. There are some situations, however, where the performance measures alone may not be sensitive enough to detect differences. This limitation can be seen from the fact that the graph viewer may achieve the same level of performance by devoting different amounts of cognitive effort. In addition, it is not often that individual performance measures are consistently in favor of a particular visualization. This makes design and evaluation difficult in choosing one visualization over another. In an attempt to overcome the above-mentioned limitations, we measure the effectiveness of graph visualizations from a cognitive load perspective. Human memory as an information processing system and recent results from cognitive load research are reviewed first. The construct of cognitive load in the context of graph visualization is proposed and discussed. A model of user task performance, mental effort and cognitive load is proposed thereafter to further reveal the interacting relations between these three concepts. A cognitive load measure called mental effort is introduced and this measure is further combined with traditional performance measures into a single multi-dimensional measure called visualization efficiency. The proposed model and measurements are tested in a user study for validity. Implications of the cognitive load considerations in graph visualization are discussed.",

      "abstractNote": "Effectively showing the relationships between objects in a dataset is one of the main tasks in information visualization. Typically there is a well-defined notion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as principal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the objects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other. In another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where related nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also visualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit representation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques, characterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information: node diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these three types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different tasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based tasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links and group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and accuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not negatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group diagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks. These conclusions contradict results in other studies, in similar but subtly different settings. Taken together, however, such results can have significant implications for the design of standard and domain snecific visualizations tools.",

      "abstractNote": "Software systems are often modeled and visualized as graphs in order to understand their higher-level structure: code entities are connected by dependencies or couplings. However, when only considering one type of code coupling such as method calls, the understanding gained stays limited to this specific aspect. Encoding multiple types of code coupling in the graph promises to broaden the understanding. Different approaches already exist for visually discerning those types in graph diagrams. In this paper, we study two of these techniquesa node-link and a matrix approach-in a realistic scenario where the classes and interfaces of a system are connected by six different types of code coupling. The explorative user study that we conducted with interactive versions of the two visualizations focuses on getting an insight on how software developers use the visualizations for understanding an unknown system. We classified typical visual structures that the participants were able to identify and connected these structures to software engineering problems. Despite the fundamental difference in approach, the participants identified the same graph structures targeting similar tasks with both visualizations.",

      "abstractNote": "Analyzing networks involves understanding the complex relationships between entities, as well as any attributes they may have. The widely used node-link diagrams excel at this task, but many are difﬁcult to extract meaning from because of the inherent complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem we introduce a technique called motif simpliﬁcation, in which common patterns of nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs have several beneﬁts: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor, connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes. We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector, and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates the effectiveness of motif simpliﬁcation.",

      "abstractNote": "Networks have remained a challenge for information visualization designers because of the complex issues of node and link layout coupled with the rich set of tasks that users present. This paper offers a strategy based on two principles: (1) layouts are based on user-defined semantic substrates, which are non-overlapping regions in which node placement is based on node attributes, (2) users interactively adjust sliders to control link visibility to limit clutter and thus ensure comprehensibility of source and destination. Scalability is further facilitated by user control of which nodes are visible. We illustrate our semantic substrates approach as implemented in NVSS 1.0 with legal precedent data for up to 1122 court cases in three regions with 7645 legal citations",

Our method provides an interactive attribute-based clustering facility. Clustering results in metric, hierarchical and relational data, represented in a single visualization. To visualize hierarchically structured quantitative data, we introduce a novel technique: the bar tree. We combine this with a node-link diagram to visualize the hierarchy and an arc diagram to visualize relational data. Our method enables the user to gain significant insight into large state transition graphs containing tens of thousands of nodes. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a real-world use case. The graph we consider models the behavior of an industrial wafer stepper and contains 55 043 nodes and 289 443 edges",

This paper presents PatternFinder, an integrated interface for query and result-set visualization for search and discovery of temporal patterns within multivariate and categorical data sets. We define temporal patterns as sequences of events with inter-event time spans. PatternFinder allows users to specify the attributes of events and time spans to produce powerful pattern queries that are difficult to express with other formalisms. We characterize the range of queries PatternFinder supports as users vary the specificity at which events and time spans are defined. Pattern Finder's query capabilities together with coupled ball-and-chain and tabular visualizations enable users to effectively query, explore and analyze event patterns both within and across data entities (e.g. patient histories, terrorist groups, Web logs, etc.)",

Methods either try to visualize all variables simultaneously at each position using glyph-based approaches or use linked views for the interaction between attribute space and physical domain such as brushing of scatterplots. Most visualizations of the attribute space are either difficult to understand or suffer from visual clutter. We propose a transformation of the high-dimensional data in attribute space to 2D that results in a point cloud, called attribute cloud, such that points with similar multivariate attributes are located close to each other. The transformation is based on ideas from multivariate density estimation and manifold learning. The resulting attribute cloud is an easy to understand visualization of multivariate data in two dimensions. We explain several techniques to incorporate additional information into the attribute cloud, that help the user get a better understanding of multivariate data.

      "abstractNote": "Spatial interactions (or flows), such as population migration and disease spread, naturally form a weighted location-to-location network (graph). Such geographically embedded networks (graphs) are usually very large. For example, the county-to-county migration data in the U.S. has thousands of counties and about a million migration paths. Moreover, many variables are associated with each flow, such as the number of migrants for different age groups, income levels, and occupations. It is a challenging task to visualize such data and discover network structures, multivariate relations, and their geographic patterns simultaneously. This paper addresses these challenges by developing an integrated interactive visualization framework that consists three coupled components: (1) a spatially constrained graph partitioning method that can construct a hierarchy of geographical regions (communities), where there are more flows or connections within regions than across regions; (2) a multivariate clustering and visualization method to detect and present multivariate patterns in the aggregated region-to-region flows; and (3) a highly interactive flow mapping component to map both flow and multivariate patterns in the geographic space, at different hierarchical levels. The proposed approach can process relatively large data sets and effectively discover and visualize major flow structures and multivariate relations at the same time. User interactions are supported to facilitate the understanding of both an overview and detailed patterns.",

      "abstractNote": "Information theory provides a theoretical framework for measuring information content for an observed variable, and has attracted much attention from visualization researchers for its ability to quantify saliency and similarity among variables. In this paper, we present a new approach towards building an exploration framework based on information theory to guide the users through the multivariate data exploration process. In our framework, we compute the total entropy of the multivariate data set and identify the contribution of individual variables to the total entropy. The variables are classified into groups based on a novel graph model where a node represents a variable and the links encode the mutual information shared between the variables. The variables inside the groups are analyzed for their representativeness and an information based importance is assigned. We exploit specific information metrics to analyze the relationship between the variables and use the metrics to choose isocontours of selected variables. For a chosen group of points, parallel coordinates plots (PCP) are used to show the states of the variables and provide an interface for the user to select values of interest. Experiments with different data sets reveal the effectiveness of our proposed framework in depicting the interesting regions of the data sets taking into account the interaction among the variables.",

Such data types are commonly encountered in transportation, shipping, and logistics industries. Due to the scale and complexity of the data, it is essential to integrate techniques for data analysis, visualization, and exploration. We present new visual representations, Petal and Thread, to effectively present many-to-many network data including multi-attribute vectors. In addition, we deploy an information-theoretic model for anomaly detection across varying dimensions, displaying highlighted anomalies in a visually consistent manner, as well as supporting a managed process of exploration. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed methodology through data exploration and an empirical study.",

      "abstractNote": "We present a novel uncertain network visualization technique based on node-link diagrams. Nodes expand spatially in our probabilistic graph layout, depending on the underlying probability distributions of edges. The visualization is created by computing a two-dimensional graph embedding that combines samples from the probabilistic graph. A Monte Carlo process is used to decompose a probabilistic graph into its possible instances and to continue with our graph layout technique. Splatting and edge bundling are used to visualize point clouds and network topology. The results provide insights into probability distributions for the entire network-not only for individual nodes and edges. We validate our approach using three data sets that represent a wide range of network types: synthetic data, protein-protein interactions from the STRING database, and travel times extracted from Google Maps. Our approach reveals general limitations of the force-directed layout and allows the user to recognize that some nodes of the graph are at a specific position just by chance.",

      "abstractNote": "Node-link diagrams provide an intuitive way to explore networks and have inspired a large number of automated graph layout strategies that optimize aesthetic criteria. However, any particular drawing approach cannot fully satisfy all these criteria simultaneously, producing drawings with visual ambiguities that can impede the understanding of network structure. To bring attention to these potentially problematic areas present in the drawing, this paper presents a technique that highlights common types of visual ambiguities: ambiguous spatial relationships between nodes and edges, visual overlap between community structures, and ambiguity in edge bundling and metanodes. Metrics, including newly proposed metrics for abnormal edge lengths, visual overlap in community structures and node/edge aggregation, are proposed to quantify areas of ambiguity in the drawing. These metrics and others are then displayed using a heatmap-based visualization that provides visual feedback to developers of graph drawing and visualization approaches, allowing them to quickly identify misleading areas. The novel metrics and the heatmap-based visualization allow a user to explore ambiguities in graph layouts from multiple perspectives in order to make reasonable graph layout choices. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated through case studies and expert reviews.",

      "abstractNote": "We explore the effectiveness of visualizing dense directed graphs by replacing individual edges with edges connected to 'modules'-or groups of nodes-such that the new edges imply aggregate connectivity. We only consider techniques that offer a lossless compression: that is, where the entire graph can still be read from the compressed version. The techniques considered are: a simple grouping of nodes with identical neighbor sets; Modular Decomposition which permits internal structure in modules and allows them to be nested; and Power Graph Analysis which further allows edges to cross module boundaries. These techniques all have the same goal-to compress the set of edges that need to be rendered to fully convey connectivity-but each successive relaxation of the module definition permits fewer edges to be drawn in the rendered graph. Each successive technique also, we hypothesize, requires a higher degree of mental effort to interpret. We test this hypothetical trade-off with two studies involving human participants. For Power Graph Analysis we propose a novel optimal technique based on constraint programming. This enables us to explore the parameter space for the technique more precisely than could be achieved with a heuristic. Although applicable to many domains, we are motivated by-and discuss in particular-the application to software dependency analysis.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently there has been increasing research interest in displaying graphs with curved edges to produce more readable visualizations. While there are several automatic techniques, little has been done to evaluate their effectiveness empirically. In this paper we present two experiments studying the impact of edge curvature on graph readability. The goal is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of using curved edges for common graph tasks compared to straight line segments, which are the conventional choice for showing edges in node-link diagrams. We included several edge variations: straight edges, edges with different curvature levels, and mixed straight and curved edges. During the experiments, participants were asked to complete network tasks including determination of connectivity, shortest path, node degree, and common neighbors. We also asked the participants to provide subjective ratings of the aesthetics of different edge types. The results show significant performance differences between the straight and curved edges and clear distinctions between variations of curved edges.",

      "abstractNote": "There are a growing number of machine learning algorithms which operate on graphs. Example applications for these algorithms include predicting which customers will recommend products to their friends in a viral marketing campaign using a customer network, predicting the topics of publications in a citation network, or predicting the political affiliations of people in a social network. It is important for an analyst to have tools to help compare the output of these machine learning algorithms. In this work, we present G-PARE, a visual analytic tool for comparing two uncertain graphs, where each uncertain graph is produced by a machine learning algorithm which outputs probabilities over node labels. G-PARE provides several different views which allow users to obtain a global overview of the algorithms output, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. By providing an adaptive exploration environment, G-PARE guides the users to places in the graph where two algorithms predictions agree and places where they disagree. This enables the user to follow cascades of misclassifications by comparing the algorithms outcome with the ground truth. After describing the features of G-PARE, we illustrate its utility through several use cases based on networks from different domains.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional layered graph depictions such as flow charts are in wide use. Yet as graphs grow more complex, these depictions can become difficult to understand. Quilts are matrix-based depictions for layered graphs designed to address this problem. In this research, we first improve Quilts by developing three design alternatives, and then compare the best of these alternatives to better-known node-link and matrix depictions. A primary weakness in Quilts is their depiction of skip links, links that do not simply connect to a succeeding layer. Therefore in our first study, we compare Quilts using color-only, text-only, and mixed (color and text) skip link depictions, finding that path finding with the color-only depiction is significantly slower and less accurate, and that in certain cases, the mixed depiction offers an advantage over the text-only depiction. In our second study, we compare Quilts using the mixed depiction to node-link diagrams and centered matrices. Overall results show that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts (46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams. This speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs, 55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions).",

      "abstractNote": "Visual exploration and analysis is a process of discovering and dissecting the abundant and complex attribute relationships that pervade multidimensional data. Recent research has identified and characterized patterns of multiple coordinated views, such as cross-filtered views, in which rapid sequences of simple interactions can be used to express queries on subsets of attribute values. In visualizations designed around these patterns, for the most part, distinct views serve to visually isolate each attribute from the others. Although the brush-and-click simplicity of visual isolation facilitates discovery of many-to-many relationships between attributes, dissecting these relationships into more fine-grained one-to-many relationships is interactively tedious and, worse, visually fragmented over prolonged sequences of queries. This paper describes: (1) a method for interactively dissecting multidimensional data by iteratively slicing and manipulating a multigraph representation of data values and value co-occurrences; and (2) design strategies for extending the construction of coordinated multiple view interfaces for dissection as well as discovery of attribute relationships in multidimensional data sets. Using examples from different domains, we describe how attribute relationship graphs can be combined with cross-filtered views, modularized for reuse across designs, and integrated into broader visual analysis tools. The exploratory and analytic utility of these examples suggests that an attribute relationship graph would be a useful addition to a wide variety of visual analysis tools.",

Our graph analytics model is co-developed by users and researchers, who carefully studied the functional requirements that reflect the critical thinking and interaction pattern of a real-life intelligence analyst. To evaluate the model, we implement a system prototype, known as GreenHornet, which allows our analysts to test the theory in practice, identify the technological and usage-related gaps in the model, and then adapt the new technology in their work space. The paper describes the implementation of GreenHornet and compares its strengths and weaknesses against the other prevailing models and tools.",

      "abstractNote": "A common goal in graph visualization research is the design of novel techniques for displaying an overview of an entire graph. However, there are many situations where such an overview is not relevant or practical for users, as analyzing the global structure may not be related to the main task of the users that have semi-specific information needs. Furthermore, users accessing large graph databases through an online connection or users running on less powerful (mobile) hardware simply do not have the resources needed to compute these overviews. In this paper, we advocate an interaction model that allows users to remotely browse the immediate context graph around a specific node of interest. We show how Furnas' original degree of interest function can be adapted from trees to graphs and how we can use this metric to extract useful contextual subgraphs, control the complexity of the generated visualization and direct users to interesting datapoints in the context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an exploration of a dense online database containing over 3 million legal citations.",

      "abstractNote": "We present Cardiogram, a visual analytics system that supports automotive engineers in debugging masses of traces each consisting of millions of recorded messages from in-car communication networks. With their increasing complexity, ensuring these safety-critical networks to be error-free has become a major task and challenge for automotive engineers. To overcome shortcomings of current analysis tools, Cardiogram combines visualization techniques with a data preprocessing approach to automatically reduce complexity based on engineers’ domain knowledge. In this paper, we provide the ﬁndings from an exploratory, three-year ﬁeld study within a large automotive company, studying current practices of engineers, the challenges they meet and the characteristics for integrating novel visual analytics tools into their work practices. We then introduce Cardiogram, discuss how our ﬁeld analysis inﬂuenced our design decisions, and present a qualitative, long-term, in-depth evaluation. Results of this study showed that our participants successfully used Cardiogram to increase the amount of analyzable information, to externalize domain knowledge, and to provide new insights into trace data. Our design approach ﬁnally led to the adoption of Cardiogram into engineers’ daily practices.",

      "abstractNote": "Task taxonomies for graph and network visualizations focus on tasks commonly encountered when analyzing graph connectivity and topology. However, in many application fields such as the social sciences (social networks), biology (protein interaction models), software engineering (program call graphs), connectivity and topology information is intertwined with group, clustering, and hierarchical information. Several recent visualization techniques, such as BubbleSets, LineSets and GMap, make explicit use of grouping and clustering, but evaluating such visualization has been difficult due to the lack of standardized group-level tasks. With this in mind, our goal is to define a new set of tasks that assess group-level comprehension. We propose several types of group-level tasks and provide several examples of each type. Finally, we characterize some of the proposed tasks using the multi-level typology of abstract visualization tasks. We believe that adding group-level tasks to the task taxonomy for graph visualization would make the taxonomy more useful for the recent graph visualization techniques. It would help evaluators define and categorize new tasks, and it would help generalize individual results collected in controlled experiments.",

Here, we present a design aimed at automating the process of performing quantitative and qualitative evaluations of graph visualizations by leveraging crowdsourcing, and a set of predeﬁned evaluation modules based on a graph task taxonomy. Speciﬁcally, we allow designers to quickly set up a user study with representative graph tasks, measurable metrics, and evaluation methods. Our system then uses a thin-client architecture to automatically generate a web accessible user study from our desktop visualization, places the study on Mechanical Turk, and uses a statistical package to automatically process incoming results. To evaluate our system, we performed three concrete evaluation studies, all of which were conﬁgured and deployed in less than an hour. We discuss how our system can be used for automatic evaluations of interactive graph visualizations, how it can facilitate evaluation of alternative designs during iterative design processes, and how it could be used to ﬁnd good default conﬁgurations for graph visualizations.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite extensive research, it is still difficult to produce effective interactive layouts for large graphs. Dense layout and occlusion make food webs, ontologies, and social networks difficult to understand and interact with. We propose a new interactive Visual Analytics component called TreePlus that is based on a tree-style layout. TreePlus reveals the missing graph structure with visualization and interaction while maintaining good readability. To support exploration of the local structure of the graph and gathering of information from the extensive reading of labels, we use a guiding metaphor of “Plant a seed and watch it grow.” It allows users to start with a node and expand the graph as needed, which complements the classic overview techniques than can be effective at - but often limited to - revealing clusters. We describe our design goals, describe the interface, and report on a controlled user study with 28 participants comparing TreePlus with a traditional graph interface for six tasks. In general, the advantage of TreePlus over the traditional interface increased as the density of the displayed data increased. Participants also reported higher levels of confidence in their answers with TreePlus and most of them preferred TreePlus.",

      "abstractNote": "Although one of the most durable analytic frameworks in political science, policy typologies suffer from some well-known flaws. Key among these is the problem of classification: thus far, it has proved impossible to consistently and objectively assign specific policies into conceptually distinct categories. The ambitious original promise of policy typologies, that is, to provide a precursor to a general theory of politics has gone unfulfilled in no small part because of the inability to overcome the classification obstacle. This article reexamines the idea of policy classification by assessing the potential contributions of policy taxonomies. Although a taxonomic approach to policy classification raises problems of its own, it may offer advantages above and beyond traditional typologies.",

      "abstractNote": "Providing insight in complex networks or graphs with multivariate data is one of the main challenges for visual analysis today. Much work has been done for visualizing information on nodes, but the space in between has mostly not been used yet. We developed a user study based on two techniques called Partially filled Bars and Bars of Varying Height and asked subjects to perform different tasks. We briefly present both techniques and our design of a large user study. Our goal is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches compared to each other. After describing our evaluation setup and our initial hypothesis, the results are analyzed, discussed and the most accepted configuration is presented. Finally we briefly discuss the outcome of the user study and our next steps for further investigations.",

      "abstractNote": "We introduce an information visualization technique, known as GreenCurve, for large multivariate sparse graphs that exhibit small-world properties. Our fractal-based design approach uses spatial cues to approximate the node connections and thus eliminates the links between the nodes in the visualization. The paper describes a robust algorithm to order the neighboring nodes of a large sparse graph by solving the Fiedler vector of its graph Laplacian, and then fold the graph nodes into a space-filling fractal curve based on the Fiedler vector. The result is a highly compact visualization that gives a succinct overview of the graph with guaranteed visibility of every graph node. GreenCurve is designed with the power grid infrastructure in mind. It is intended for use in conjunction with other visualization techniques to support electric power grid operations. The research and development of GreenCurve was conducted in collaboration with domain experts who understand the challenges and possibilities intrinsic to the power grid infrastructure. The paper reports a case study on applying GreenCurve to a power grid problem and presents a usability study to evaluate the design claims that we set forth.",

      "abstractNote": "The amount of data produced in the world every day implies a huge challenge in understanding and extracting knowledge from it. Much of this data is of relational nature, such as social networks, metabolic pathways, or links between software components. Traditionally, those networks are represented as node-link diagrams or matrix representations. They help us to understand the structure (topology) of the relational data. However in many real world data sets, additional (often multidimensional) attributes are attached to the network elements. One challenge is to show these attributes in context of the underlying network topology in order to support the user in further analyses. In this paper, we present a novel approach that extends traditional force-based graph layouts to create an attribute-driven layout. In addition, our prototype implementation supports interactive exploration by introducing clustering and multidimensional scaling into the analysis process.",

      "abstractNote": "Biologists hope to address grand scientific challenges by exploring the abundance of data made available through modern microarray technology and other high-throughput techniques. The impact of this data, however, is limited unless researchers can effectively assimilate such complex information and integrate it into their daily research; interactive visualization tools are called for to support the effort. Specifically, typical studies of gene co-expression require novel visualization tools that enable the dynamic formulation and fine-tuning of hypotheses to aid the process of evaluating sensitivity of key parameters. These tools should allow biologists to develop an intuitive understanding of the structure of biological networks and discover genes residing in critical positions in networks and pathways. By using a graph as a universal representation of correlation in gene expression, our system employs several techniques that when used in an integrated manner provide innovative analytical capabilities. Our tool for interacting with gene co-expression data integrates techniques such as: graph layout, qualitative subgraph extraction through a novel 2D user interface, quantitative subgraph extraction using graph-theoretic algorithms or by compound queries, dynamic level-of-detail abstraction, and template-based fuzzy classification. We demonstrate our system using a real-world workflow from a large-scale, systems genetics study of mammalian gene coexpression.",

      "abstractNote": "Multivariate networks are data sets that describe not only the relationships between a set of entities but also their attributes. In this paper, we present a new technique to determine the layout of a multivariate network using geodesic self-organizing map (GeoSOM). During the training process of a GeoSOM, graph distances are non-linearly combined with attribute similarities based on the network's graph distance distribution. The resulted layout has less edge crossings than those generated by the previous methods. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of this hybrid approach. The results were compared against the most commonly used glyph-based technique. The user study shows that the hybrid approach helps users draw conclusions from both the relationship and vertex attributes of a multivariate network more quickly and accurately. In addition, users found it easier to compare different relationships of the same set of entities. Finally, the capability of the hybrid approach is demonstrated using the world military expenditures and weapon transfer networks.",

      "abstractNote": "Ego-network is built with a specific individual, i.e., the ego, and individuals connected to it, i.e., alter. As an abstraction of connection between individual and outside world, it usually has multiple attributions and has been applied to many research fields. Multivariate ego-network evolution assists users analyzing individual characteristic and hidden pattern in the network. However, most of current studies suffer from limited analysis levels and restricted network evolution analysis techniques. In this paper, we propose MENA, a visual analysis system to display, explore and analyze multivariate ego-network evolution. MENA allows users to analyze ego-network at global, subgroup and node/link level. Besides, automatic analysis and timeline are integrated in our approach to achieve evolution analysis automatically and freely. Furthermore, we evaluate MENA with academic collaboration network, which demonstrates the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.",

In particular, we defined new analysis methods such as (p,q)-core and 4-ring to identify important dense subgraphs and short cycles from the huge bipartite graphs. We applied island analysis for a specific time slice in order to identify important and meaningful subgraphs. Further, a temporal Kevin Bacon graph and a temporal two mode network are extracted in order to provide insight and knowledge on the evolution.",

      "abstractNote": "Analysts of computer-based systems often face large data sets, such as those represented in state transition graphs, in which the organizational structure is clear but interpreting the data is not. This new method lets users generate interactive visualizations that help them analyze systems more easily, accurately, and quickly. Computer scientists and engineers use state transition graphs to model and study the behavior of computer-based systems. These graphs describe sets of system states and sets of transitions. Transitions are source-action-target triples in which the execution of an action triggers a transition from a source to a target state.",

The combination of the three perspectives provides the user with a rich analysis interface that enables gaining significant insight into system behavior.

      "abstractNote": "The paper presents self-organizing graphs, a novel approach to graph layout based on a competitive learning algorithm. This method is an extension of self-organization strategies known from unsupervised neural networks, namely from Kohonen’s self-organizing map. Its main advantage is that it is very ﬂexibly adaptable to arbitrary types of visualization spaces, for it is explicitly parameterized by a metric model of the layout space. Yet the method consumes comparatively little computational resources and does not need any heavy-duty preprocessing. Unlike with other stochastic layout algorithms, not even the costly repeated evaluation of an objective function is required. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst connectionist approach to graph layout. The paper presents applications to 2D-layout as well as to 3D-layout and to layout in arbitrary metric spaces, such as networks on spherical surfaces.",

In the end readers will have the knowledge, skills, and tools to apply social network analysis across different disciplines. A fundamental redesign of the menu structure and the capability to analyze much larger networks required a new edition. This edition presents several new operations including community detection, generalized main paths searches, new network indices, advanced visualization approaches, and instructions for installing Pajek under MacOSX. This third edition is up-to-date with Pajek version 5 and it introduces PajekXXL for very large networks and Pajek3XL for huge networks.",

      "abstractNote": "Seriation is an exploratory combinatorial data analysis technique to reorder objects into a sequence along a one-dimensional continuum so that it best reveals regularity and patterning among the whole series. Unsupervised learning, using seriation and matrix reordering, allows pattern discovery simultaneously at three information levels: local fragments of relationships, sets of organized local fragments of relationships, and an overall structural pattern. This paper presents an historical overview of seriation and matrix reordering methods, several applications from the following disciplines are included in the retrospective review: archaeology and anthropology; cartography, graphics, and information visualization; sociology and sociometry; psychology and psychometry; ecology; biology and bioinformatics; cellular manufacturing; and operations research.

      "abstractNote": "In this study, we examine the use of graph ordering algorithms for visual analysis of data sets using visual similarity matrices. Visual similarity matrices display the relationships between data items in a dot-matrix plot format, with the axes labeled with the data items and points drawn if there is a relationship between two data items. The biggest challenge for displaying data using this representation is finding an ordering of the data items that reveals the internal structure of the data set. Poor orderings are indistinguishable from noise whereas a good ordering can reveal complex and subtle features of the data. We consider three general classes of algorithms for generating orderings: simple graph theoretic algorithms, symbolic sparse matrix reordering algorithms, and spectral decomposition algorithms. We apply each algorithm to synthetic and real world data sets and evaluate each algorithm for interpretability (i.e., does the algorithm lead to images with usable visual features?) and stability (i.e., does the algorithm consistently produce similar results?). We also provide a detailed discussion of the results for each algorithm across the different graph types and include a discussion of some strategies for using ordering algorithms for data analysis based on these results.",

      "abstractNote": "Visualization has proven to be a useful tool for understanding network structures. However the dynamic nature of social media networks requires powerful visualization techniques that go beyond static network diagrams. In order to provide strong temporal network visualization tools, designers need to understand what tasks that users have to accomplish. This paper describes a taxonomy of temporal network visualization tasks. We identify the (1) entities, (2) properties, and (3) a hierarchy of temporal features, which were extracted by surveying 44 existing temporal network visualization systems. By building and examining the task taxonomy, we report which tasks are well covered by existing systems and make suggestions for designing future visualization tools. The feedback from 9 network analysts helped reﬁne the taxonomy.",

With the continual growth of database size, querying these databases often results in multiple solutions. Text-based systems present search results as a list, and going over all solutions can be tedious. In this paper, we present an interactive visualization system that helps users ﬁnd patterns in graphs and visualizes the search results. The user draws a source pattern and labels it with attributes. Based on these attributes and connectivity constraints, simpliﬁed subgraphs are generated, containing all the possible solutions. The system is quite generic and capable of searching patterns and approximate solutions in a variety of data sets.",

It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it. It is also intended for use as a textbook as it is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field.",

      "abstractNote": "Multivariate graphs are proliﬁc across many ﬁelds, including transportation and neuroscience. A key task in graph analysis is the exploration of connectivity, to, for example, analyze how signals ﬂow through neurons, or to explore how well different cities are connected by ﬂights. While standard node-link diagrams are helpful in judging connectivity, they do not scale to large networks. Adjacency matrices also do not scale to large networks and are only suitable to judge connectivity of adjacent nodes. A key approach to realize scalable graph visualization are queries: instead of displaying the whole network, only a relevant subset is shown. Query-based techniques for analyzing connectivity in graphs, however, can also easily suffer from cluttering if the query result is big enough. To remedy this, we introduce techniques that provide an overview of the connectivity and reveal details on demand. We have two main contributions: (1) two novel visualization techniques that work in concert for summarizing graph connectivity; and (2) Grafﬁnity, an open-source implementation of these visualizations supplemented by detail views to enable a complete analysis workﬂow. Grafﬁnity was designed in a close collaboration with neuroscientists and is optimized for connectomics data analysis, yet the technique is applicable across domains. We validate the connectivity overview and our open-source tool with illustrative examples using ﬂight and connectomics data.",

      "abstractNote": "The rise in the use of social network sites allows us to collect large amounts of user reported data on social structures and analysis of this data could provide useful insights for many of the social sciences. This analysis is typically the domain of Social Network Analysis, and visualization of these structures often proves invaluable in understanding them. However, currently available visual analysis tools are not very well suited to handle the massive scale of this network data, and often resolve to displaying small ego networks or heavily abstracted networks. In this paper, we present Honeycomb, a visualization tool that is able to deal with much larger scale data (with millions of connections), which we illustrate by using a large scale corporate social networking site as an example. Additionally, we introduce a new probability based network metric to guide users to potentially interesting or anomalous patterns and discuss lessons learned during design and implementation.",

Geographical maps provide many spatial features and hence are easy to remember. However, graphs are often visualized as node-link diagrams with few spatial features. We evaluate whether adding static spatial features to node-link diagrams will help in graph revisitation. We discuss three strategies for embellishing a graph and evaluate each in a user study. In our ﬁrst study, we evaluate how to best add background features to a graph. In the second, we encode position using node size and color. In the third and ﬁnal study, we take the best techniques from the ﬁrst and second study, as well as shapes added to the graph as virtual landmarks, to ﬁnd the best combination of spatial features for graph revisitation. We discuss the user study results and give our recommendations for design of graph visualization software.",

      "abstractNote": "The design of multidimensional visualization techniques is based on the assumption that a graphical representation of a large dataset can give more insight to a user, by providing him/her a more intuitive support in the process of exploiting data. When developing a visualization technique, the analytic and exploratory tasks that a user might need or want to perform on the data should guide the choice of the visual and interaction metaphors implemented by the technique. Usability testing of visualization techniques also needs the definition of users’ tasks. The identification and understanding of the nature of the users’ tasks in the process of acquiring knowledge from visual representations of data is a recent branch in information visualization research. Some works have proposed taxonomies to organize tasks that a visualization technique should support. This paper proposes a taxonomy of visualization tasks, based on existing taxonomies as well as on the observation of users performing exploratory tasks in a multidimensional data set using two different visualization techniques, Parallel Coordinates and RadViz. Different scenarios involving low-level tasks were estimated for the completion of some high-level tasks, and they were compared to the scenarios observed during the users’ experiments.",

      "abstractNote": "Traditional node-link depictions of layered graphs such as flow charts and process or genealogy diagrams are in widespread use. Layers emerge from applied context (e.g. process stages or familial generations), or are inserted to improve visual clarity. However for many applications these diagrams quickly lose their utility as graph complexity grows. Layout algorithms such as crossing minimizers can preserve utility for larger graphs, but also quickly reach their limits. We introduce quilting, an interactive, matrix-based depiction for very large layered graphs that remains useful even when optimized node and link depictions have become unintelligible. We demonstrate quilting using an activity-based management (ABM) application that must depict layered graphs with thousands or even hundreds of thousands of nodes. Unlike node-link depictions, quilts depict 500-node graphs quite clearly. On typical desktop displays, quilts depicting larger graphs must be summarized.",

      "abstractNote": "A multivariate network is a graph whose nodes contain multi-dimensional attributes. We propose a method to visualize such a network using spherical Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and circular layout. The spherical SOM produced an initial graph layout by grouping nodes with similar attributes to adjacent areas on the sphere. The circular layout algorithm ﬁne tunes the position of each node to avoid nodenode/node-edge overlap and minimize the number of edge crossings. We also implement an interface to project the spherical image onto a 2D plane such that the user can have a global view of the data set. The user is allowed to select any point of interest to be the center of the 2D projection.",

      "abstractNote": "One bottleneck in large-scale genome sequencing projects is reconstructing the full genome sequence from the short subsequences produced by current technologies. The final stages of the genome assembly process inevitably require manual inspection of data inconsistencies and could be greatly aided by visualization. This paper presents our design decisions in translating key data features identified through discussions with analysts into a concise visual encoding. Current visualization tools in this domain focus on local sequence errors making high-level inspection of the assembly difficult if not impossible. We present a novel interactive graph display, ABySS-Explorer, that emphasizes the global assembly structure while also integrating salient data features such as sequence length. Our tool replaces manual and in some cases pen-and-paper based analysis tasks, and we discuss how user feedback was incorporated into iterative design refinements. Finally, we touch on applications of this representation not initially considered in our design phase, suggesting the generality of this encoding for DNA sequence data.",

These networks first appeared in the study social networks and were shown to be relevant models in other application domains such as software reverse engineering and biology. Furthermore, many of these networks actually have a multiscale nature: they can be viewed as a network of groups that are themselves small world networks. We describe a metric that has been designed in order to identify the weakest edges in a small world network leading to an easy and low cost filtering procedure that breaks up a graph into smaller and highly connected components. We show how this metric can be exploited through an interactive navigation of the network based on semantic zooming. Once the network is decomposed into a hierarchy of sub-networks, a user can easily find groups and subgroups of actors and understand their dynamics.",

      "abstractNote": "In Web data, telecommunications traffic and in epidemiological studies, dense subgraphs correspond to subsets of subjects (i.e. users, patients) that share a collection of attributes values (i.e. accessed Web pages, email-calling patterns or disease diagnostic profiles). Visual and computational identification of these \"clusters\" becomes useful when domain experts desire to determine those factors of major influence in the formation of access and communication clusters or in the detection and contention of disease spread. With the current increases in graphic hardware capabilities and RAM sizes, it is more useful to relate graph sizes to the available screen real estate S and the amount of available RAM M, instead of the number of edges or nodes in the graph. We offer a visual interface that is parameterized by M and S and is particularly suited for navigation tasks that require the identification of subgraphs whose edge density is above certain threshold. This is achieved by providing a zoomable matrix view of the underlying data. This view is strongly coupled to a hierarchical view of the essential information elements present in the data domain. We illustrate the applicability of this work to the visual navigation of cancer incidence data and to an aggregated sample of phone call traffic",

      "abstractNote": "Visualizing network data, from tree structures to arbitrarily connected graphs, is a diﬃcult problem in information visualization. A large part of the problem is that in network data, users not only have to visualize the attributes speciﬁc to each data item, but also the links specifying how those items are connected to each other. Past approaches to resolving these diﬃculties focus on zooming, clustering, ﬁltering and applying various methods of laying out nodes and edges. Such approaches, however, focus only on optimizing a network visualization in a single view, limiting the amount of information that can be shown and explored in parallel. Moreover, past approaches do not allow users to cross reference diﬀerent subsets or aspects of large, complex networks. In this paper, we propose an approach to these limitations using multiple coordinated views of a given network. To illustrate our approach, we implement a tool called DualNet and evaluate the tool with a case study using an email communication network. We show how using multiple coordinated views improves navigation and provides insight into large networks with multiple node and link properties and types.",

Four easy-to-program network layout techniques are discussed, with details given for implementing each one: force-directed node-link diagrams, arc diagrams, adjacency matrices, and circular layouts. A Java applet demonstrating these layouts, with open source code, is available at http://www.michaelmcguffin.com/research/simpleNetVis/.

      "abstractNote": "The visualization of graphs has proven to be very useful for exploring structures in different application domains. However, in certain fields of computer science, graph visualization is understood and focused quite differently. While \"graph drawing\" focuses on optimized layouts for node-link-representations of networks, \"information visualization\" prefers to work on hierarchies focusing on very large structures, different views and interactivity. This paper gives a systematic view of the problem of graph visualization by combining both approaches. We introduce a general view of different visualization methods as well as describe occurring problems and discuss basic constraints. These are used to propose a visualization framework for graphs, whose development motivated this paper",

Our model of personal history data groups events into aggregates which are contained in facets (e.g. doctor visits, hospitalizations, or lab tests). Links enable representation of arbitrary relationships across events and aggregates. Data attributes such as severity can be mapped by data administrators to visual attributes such as color and line thickness. End-users have powerful controls over the display contents and they can modify the mapping to fit their tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "In this work, we introduce EdgeMaps as a new method for integrating the visualization of explicit and implicit data relations. Explicit relations are speciﬁc connections between entities already present in a given dataset, while implicit relations are derived from multidimensional data based on shared properties and similarity measures. Many datasets include both types of relations, which are often diﬃcult to represent together in information visualizations. Node-link diagrams typically focus on explicit data connections, while not incorporating implicit similarities between entities. Multi-dimensional scaling considers similarities between items, however, explicit links between nodes are not displayed. In contrast, EdgeMaps visualize both implicit and explicit relations by combining and complementing spatialization and graph drawing techniques. As a case study for this approach we chose a dataset of philosophers, their interests, inﬂuences, and birthdates. By introducing the limitation of activating only one node at a time, interesting visual patterns emerge that resemble the aesthetics of ﬁreworks and waves. We argue that the interactive exploration of these patterns may allow the viewer to grasp the structure of a graph better than complex node-link visualizations.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: The rapid progress of post-genomic analyses, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has resulted in the generation of large amounts of quantitative data covering and connecting the complete cascade from genotype to phenotype for individual organisms. Various benefits can be achieved when these \"Omics\" data are integrated, such as the identification of unknown gene functions or the elucidation of regulatory networks of whole organisms. In order to be able to obtain deeper insights in the generated datasets, it is of utmost importance to present the data to the researcher in an intuitive, integrated, and knowledge-based environment. Therefore, various visualization paradigms have been established during the last years. The visualization of \"Omics\" data using metabolic pathway maps is intuitive and has been applied in various software tools. It has become obvious that the application of web-based and user driven software tools has great potential and benefits from the use of open and standardized formats for the description of pathways.",

Hierarchical clustering has been extensively used to analyze gene expression data, and we show how optimal leaf ordering can reveal biological structure that is not observed with an existing heuristic ordering method. For a tree with n leaves, there are 2n−1 linear orderings consistent with the structure of the tree. Our optimal leaf ordering algorithm runs in time O(n4), and we present further improvements that make the running time of our algorithm practical.",

      "abstractNote": "We take a new, scenario based look at evaluation in information visualization. Our seven scenarios, evaluating visual data analysis and reasoning, evaluating user performance, evaluating user experience, evaluating environments and work practices, evaluating communication through visualization, automated evaluation of visualizations, and evaluating collaborative data analysis were derived through an extensive literature review of over 800 visualization publications. These scenarios are described through their goals, the types of questions they embody and illustrated through example studies. Through this broad survey and the distillation of these scenarios we make two contributions. One, we encapsulate the current practices in the information visualization research community and, two, we provide a different approach to reaching decisions about what might be the most effective evaluation of a given information visualization. For example, if the research goals or evaluative questions are known they can be used to map to speciﬁc scenarios, where practical existing examples can be considered for effective evaluation approaches.",

      "abstractNote": "Heuristic evaluation is a well known discount evaluation technique in human-computer interaction (HCI) but has not been utilized in information visualization (InfoVis) to the same extent. While several sets of heuristics have been used or proposed for InfoVis, it is not yet known what kind of heuristics are useful for ﬁnding general InfoVis problems. We performed a meta-analysis with the goal of exploring the issues of heuristic evaluation for InfoVis. This meta-analysis concentrates on issues pertaining to the selection and organization of heuristics, and the process itself. For this purpose, we used three sets of previously published heuristics to assess a visual decision support system that is used to examine simulation data. The meta-analysis shows that the evaluation process and results have a high dependency on the heuristics and the types of evaluators chosen. We describe issues related to interpretation, redundancy, and conﬂict in heuristics. We also provide a discussion of generalizability and categorization of these heuristics.",

      "abstractNote": "A multiple view system uses two or more distinct views to support the investigation of a single conceptual entity. Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.",

Layout algorithms suitable for the former are too slow for the latter, requiring new algorithms or modified (often relaxed) versions of existing algorithms to be invented. The density of nodes and edges displayed per inch of screen real estate requires special visual techniques to filter the graphs and focus attention. A system for investigating and exploring such large, complex data sets needs to be able to display both graph structure and node and edge attributes so that patterns and information hidden in the data can be seen. We describe a tool that addresses these needs, the NicheWorks tool. We describe and comment on the available layout algorithms and the linked views system, and detail an example of the use of NicheWorks for analyzing web sites.",

      "abstractNote": "Evolutionary biologists are often interested in finding correlations among biological traits (or attributes) across a number of species, as such correlations may lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying function. Because some species are more closely related than others, computing and visualizing these correlations must be done in the context of the evolutionary tree that relates the species. Although dozens of visualizations for correlated traits have been developed over the decades, the recent explosive growth in the number of traits and species has created a need for a visualization that can scale to dozens of traits mapped to thousands of species and their evolutionary tree to allow the interactive exploration of complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce Det., called detective, an evolutionary tree visualization that allows biologists to see multiple attributes of leaf nodes. We describe a new tree layout algorithm to represent different branch lengths and several visualization and intereaction techniques to address user requirements. We also report informal feedbacks we collected from evolutionary biologists.",

      "abstractNote": "Recently, an approach for determining the value of a visualization was proposed, one moving beyond simple measurements of task accuracy and speed. The value equation contains components for the time savings a visualization provides, the insights and insightful questions it spurs, the overall essence of the data it conveys, and the conﬁdence about the data and its domain it inspires. This articulation of value is purely descriptive, however, providing no actionable method of assessing a visualization’s value. In this work, we create a heuristic-based evaluation methodology to accompany the value equation for assessing interactive visualizations. We refer to the methodology colloquially as ICE-T, based on an anagram of the four value components. Our approach breaks the four components down into guidelines, each of which is made up of a small set of low-level heuristics. Evaluators who have knowledge of visualization design principles then assess the visualization with respect to the heuristics. We conducted an initial trial of the methodology on three interactive visualizations of the same data set, each evaluated by 15 visualization experts. We found that the methodology showed promise, obtaining consistent ratings across the three visualizations and mirroring judgments of the utility of the visualizations by instructors of the course in which they were developed.",

      "abstractNote": "Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline. Nevertheless, there are currently no techniques to efficiently wrangle network datasets. Here we introduce a set of interaction techniques that enable analysts to carry out complex network wrangling operations. These operations include deriving attributes across connected classes, converting nodes to edges and vice-versa, and faceting nodes and edges based on attributes. We implement these operations in a web-based, open-source system, Origraph, which provides interfaces to execute the operations and investigate the results. Designed for wrangling, rather than analysis, Origraph can be used to load data in many forms, wrangle and transform the network, and export it in formats compatible with common network visualization tools. We demonstrate Origraph's usefulness in a series of examples with different datasets from a variety of sources.",

      "abstractNote": "Networks are critical to modern society, and a thorough understanding of how they behave is crucial to their efficient operation. Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing this data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding. Our focus is on visualizing the data associated with a network and not on simply visualizing the structure of the network itself. We begin with three static network displays; two of these use geographical relationships, while the third is a matrix arrangement that gives equal emphasis to all network links. Static displays can be swamped with large amounts of data; hence we introduce direct-manipulation techniques that permit the graphs to continue to reveal relationships in the context of much more data. In effect, the static displays are parameterized so that interesting views may easily be discovered interactively. The software to carry out this network visualization is called SeeNet.",

      "abstractNote": "DNA microarrays are used to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. In a time series experiment, the gene expressions are measured as a function of time. We present an application for integrated visualization of genome expression and network dynamics in both regulatory networks and metabolic pathways. Integration of these two levels of cellular processes is necessary, since it provides the link between the measurements at the transcriptional level (gene expression levels approximated from microarray data) and the phenotype (the observable characteristics of an organism) at the functional and behavioral level. The integration requires visualization approaches besides traditional clustering and statistical analysis methods. Our application can (i) visualize the data from time series experiments in the context of a regulatory network and KEGG metabolic pathways; (ii) identify and visualize active regulatory subnetworks from the gene expression data; (iii) perform a statistical test to identify and subsequently visualize pathways that are affected by differentially expressed genes. We present a case study, which demonstrates that our approach and application both facilitates and speeds up data analysis tremendously in comparison to a more traditional approach that involves many manual, laborious, and error-prone steps.",

We discuss how different techniques take effect at speciﬁc stages of the visualization pipeline and how they apply to multi-variate data sets being composed of scalars, vectors and tensors. We also provide a categorization of these techniques with the aim for a better overview of related approaches. Based on this classiﬁcation we highlight combinable and hybrid approaches and focus on techniques that potentially lead towards new directions in visualization research. In the second part of this paper we take a look at recent techniques that are useful for the visualization of complex data sets either because they are general purpose or because they can be adapted to speciﬁc problems.",

      "abstractNote": "A semantic substrate is a spatial template for a network, where nodes are grouped into regions and laid out within each region according to one or more node attributes. This paper shows how users can be given control in designing their own substrates and how this ability leads to a different approach to network data exploration. Users can create a semantic substrate, enter their data, get feedback from domain experts, edit the semantic substrate, and iteratively continue this procedure until the domain experts are satisfied with the insights they have gained. We illustrate this process in two case studies with domain experts working with legal precedents and food webs. Guidelines for designing substrates are provided, including how to locate, size, and align regions in a substrate, which attributes to choose for grouping nodes into regions, how to select placement methods and which attributes to set as parameters of the selected placement method. Throughout the paper, examples are illustrated with NVSS 2.0, the network visualization tool developed to explore the semantic substrate idea.",

      "abstractNote": "Biological networks are widely used to represent processes in biological systems and to capture interactions and dependencies between biological entities. Their size and complexity is steadily increasing due to the ongoing growth of knowledge in the life sciences. To aid understanding of biological networks several algorithms for laying out and graphically representing networks and network analysis results have been developed. However, current algorithms are specialized to particular layout styles and therefore different algorithms are required for each kind of network and/or style of layout. This increases implementation effort and means that new algorithms must be developed for new layout styles. Furthermore, additional effort is necessary to compose different layout conventions in the same diagram. Also the user cannot usually customize the placement of nodes to tailor the layout to their particular need or task and there is little support for interactive network exploration.",

      "abstractNote": "Communities in social networks emerge from interactions among individuals and can be analyzed through a combination of clustering and graph layout algorithms. These approaches result in 2D or 3D visualizations of clustered graphs, with groups of vertices representing individuals that form a community. However, in many instances the vertices have attributes that divide individuals into distinct categories such as gender, profession, geographic location, and similar. It is often important to investigate what categories of individuals comprise each community and vice-versa, how the community structures associate the individuals from the same category. Currently, there are no effective methods for analyzing both the community structure and the category-based partitions of social graphs. We propose Group-In-a-Box (GIB), a metalayout for clustered graphs that enables multi-faceted analysis of networks. It uses the treemap space filling technique to display each graph cluster or category group within its own box, sized according to the number of vertices therein. GIB optimizes visualization of the network sub-graphs, providing a semantic substrate for category-based and cluster-based partitions of social graphs. We illustrate the application of GIB to multi-faceted analysis of real social networks and discuss desirable properties of GIB using synthetic datasets.",

The present article reviews some basic concepts, important progress, and significant results in the current studies of various complex networks, with emphasis on the relationship between the topology and the dynamics of such complex networks. Some fundamental properties and typical complex network models are described; and, as an example, epidemic dynamics are analyzed and discussed in some detail. Finally, the important issue of robustness versus fragility of dynamical synchronization in complex networks is introduced and discussed.",

Researchers have successfully used alternative evaluation techniques in human-computer interaction (HCI), including focus groups, field studies, and expert reviews. These methods tend to produce qualitative results and require fewer participants than controlled experiments. In this article, we focus on expert reviews that we used for the applications. We commonly use expert reviews to assess interface usability. Expert reviews can generate valuable feedback on visualization tools. We recommend i) including experts with experience in data display as well as usability, and ii) developing heuristics based on visualization guidelines as well as usability guidelines. Expert reviews should not be used exclusively, since experts might not hilly predict end-user actions. Furthermore, we encourage more experimentation with this technique, particularly to develop a good set of visualization heuristics and to compare it with other methods.",

SpaceViz has scanned, map and manage PC, network and cloud storage of multimedia data. Classical, space-filling squarified techniques are used as methodology, but differ from Tree-map single view in that it employs multiple views in two-dimensional space, which is used to more clearly the structural relationships of data from colour code and pattern based hierarchy. The paper includes an empirical study comparing SpaceViz and Tree-map. The study shows the participants perform significantly better to interact with multiple file formats using SpaceViz.",

      "abstractNote": "In this paper, we discuss and evaluate the handling of uncertainty in visual network analysis, i.e. the uncertainty of edge attributes. This can be useful to answer a question like ”How reliable is a flow rate value on a specific edge/pipeline?”. For investigating the most suitable and most intuitive representation of uncertain edge attributes in visual network analysis, we extend the state of the art in uncertain edge visualization. We present and compare four different approaches in a large user study to gain insight into effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. In our user study, we show that dashed lines are the most promising method in general. But, depending on the task, wavy lines as well as blurred lines can be a better choice in terms of efficiency.",

      "abstractNote": "While the treemap is a popular method for visualizing hierarchical data, it is often difficult for users to track layout and attribute changes when the data evolve over time. When viewing the treemaps side by side or back and forth, there exist several problems that can prevent viewers from performing effective comparisons. Those problems include abrupt layout changes, a lack of prominent visual patterns to represent layouts, and a lack of direct contrast to highlight differences. In this paper, we present strategies to visualize changes of hierarchical data using treemaps. A new treemap layout algorithm is presented to reduce abrupt layout changes and produce consistent visual patterns. Techniques are proposed to effectively visualize the difference and contrast between two treemap snapshots in terms of the map items' colors, sizes, and positions. Experimental data show that our algorithm can achieve a good balance in maintaining a treemap's stability, continuity, readability, and average aspect ratio. A software tool is created to compare treemaps and generate the visualizations. User studies show that the users can better understand the changes in the hierarchy and layout, and more quickly notice the color and size differences using our method.",

      "abstractNote": "An emerging and challenging Geovisual Analytics application domain is visualization of hierarchical regional (sub-national) statistics. The OECD regional database is a potential treasure chest for policy-makers, researchers and citizens to gain a better understanding of a region’s structure and performance and to carry out analysis of territorial trends and disparities based on sound information comparable across countries. New methods are needed to visually make comparisons between groups on different hierarchical levels, such as cities with countries or parts of countries. In this context, we demonstrate and reflect upon the potential synergy between information and geovisualization through the use of a squarified treemap dynamically linked to a choropleth map to facilitate visualization of complex hierarchical social science data. We exemplify and evaluate our approach with three usage scenarios that explore population change in the OECD countries using 1) squarified treemap, 2) regional choropleth map and 3) combined treemap and choropleth map.",

      "abstractNote": "Treemaps are a well known method for the visualization of attributed hierarchical data. Previously proposed treemap layout algorithms are limited to rectangular shapes, which cause problems with the aspect ratio of the rectangles as well as with identifying the visualized hierarchical structure. The approach of Voronoi treemaps presented in this paper eliminates these problems through enabling subdivisions of and in polygons. Additionally, this allows for creating treemap visualizations within areas of arbitrary shape, such as triangles and circles, thereby enabling a more flexible adaptation of treemaps for a wider range of applications.",

      "abstractNote": "Background: Detection of large genomic rearrangements, such as large indels, duplications or translocations is now commonly achieved by next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches. Recently, several tools have been developed to analyze NGS data but the resulting files are difficult to interpret without an additional visualization step. Circos (Genome Res, 19:1639–1645, 2009), a Perl script, is a powerful visualization software that requires setting up numerous configuration files with a large number of parameters to handle. R packages like RCircos (BMC Bioinformatics, 14:244, 2013) or ggbio (Genome Biol, 13:R77, 2012) provide functions to display genomic data as circular Circos-like plots. However, these tools are very general and lack the functions needed to filter, format and adjust specific input genomic data.\nResults: We implemented an R package called CIRCUS to analyze genomic structural variations. It generates both data and configuration files necessary for Circos, to produce graphs. Only few R pre-requisites are necessary. Options are available to deal with heterogeneous data, various chromosome numbers and multi-scale analysis.\nConclusion: CIRCUS allows fast and versatile analysis of genomic structural variants with Circos plots for users with limited coding skills.",

      "abstractNote": "Exploring communities is an important task in social network analysis. Such communities are currently identified using clustering methods to group actors. This approach often leads to actors belonging to one and only one cluster, whereas in real life a person can belong to several communities. As a solution we propose duplicating actors in social networks and discuss potential impact of such a move. Several visual duplication designs are discussed and a controlled experiment comparing network visualization with and without duplication is performed, using 6 tasks that are important for graph readability and visual interpretation of social networks. We show that in our experiment, duplications significantly improve community-related tasks but sometimes interfere with other graph readability tasks. Finally, we propose a set of guidelines for deciding when to duplicate actors and choosing candidates for duplication, and alternative ways to render them in social network representations.",

      "abstractNote": "Bundling techniques provide a visual simpliﬁcation of a graph drawing or trail set, by spatially grouping similar graph edges or trails. This way, the structure of the visualization becomes simpler and thereby easier to comprehend in terms of assessing relations that are encoded by such paths, such as ﬁnding groups of strongly interrelated nodes in a graph, ﬁnding connections between spatial regions on a map linked by a number of vehicle trails, or discerning the motion structure of a set of objects by analyzing their paths. In this state of the art report, we aim to improve the understanding of graph and trail bundling via the following main contributions. First, we propose a data-based taxonomy that organizes bundling methods on the type of data they work on (graphs vs trails, which we refer to as paths). Based on a formal deﬁnition of path bundling, we propose a generic framework that describes the typical steps of all bundling algorithms in terms of high-level operations and show how existing method classes implement these steps. Next, we propose a description of tasks that bundling aims to address. Finally, we provide a wide set of example applications of bundling techniques and relate these to the above-mentioned taxonomies. Through these contributions, we aim to help both researchers and users to understand the bundling landscape as well as its technicalities.",

      "abstractNote": "The analysis of Multivariate Networks (MVNs) can be approached from two different perspectives: a multidimensional one, consisting of the nodes and their multiple attributes, or a relational one, consisting of the network’s topology of edges. In order to be comprehensive, a visual representation of an MVN must be able to accommodate both. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the visualization of MVNs that works by combining these two perspectives into a single uniﬁed model, which is used as input to a dimensionality reduction method. The resulting 2D embedding takes into consideration both attribute- and edge-based similarities, with a user-controlled trade-off. We demonstrate our approach by exploring two real-world data sets: a co-authorship network and an open-source software development project. The results point out that our method is able to bring forward features of MVNs that could not be easily perceived from the investigation of the individual perspectives only.",

Although t-SNE is one of the best techniques for visualizing high-dimensional data as 2D scatterplots, t-SNE has not been used in the context of classical graph layout. We propose a new graph layout method, tsNET, based on representing a graph with a distance matrix, which together with a modiﬁed t-SNE cost function results in desirable layouts. We evaluate our method by a formal comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both visually and via established quality metrics on a comprehensive benchmark, containing real-world and synthetic graphs. As evidenced by the quality metrics and visual inspection, tsNET produces excellent layouts.",

Hierarchies built in the table view are shown in a customizable treemap view. One can choose both layout and rendering by a few clicks, effectively creating visual scenarios on-the-ﬂy.

      "abstractNote": "Node-link diagram, as one of the graph visualization techniques, is adopted in multiple domains including social network visualization, air traffic visualization and software analysis. However, when the number of nodes and links (edges) of a diagram increases, clutter becomes a huge problem, e.g. humans cannot distinguish nor identify edges in one graph. Edge bundling is one of the solutions for alleviating clutter. Many information visualization researchers have proposed various edge bundling techniques. In this survey, we explore the existing representative edge bundling methods briefly and provide reviews for these techniques.",

      "abstractNote": "Effective 3D streamline placement and visualization play an essential role in many science and engineering disciplines. The main challenge for effective streamline visualization lies in seed placement, i.e., where to drop seeds and how many seeds should be placed. Seeding too many or too few streamlines may not reveal flow features and patterns either because it easily leads to visual clutter in rendering or it conveys little information about the flow field. Not only does the number of streamlines placed matter, their spatial relationships also play a key role in understanding the flow field. Therefore, effective flow visualization requires the streamlines to be placed in the right place and in the right amount. This paper introduces hierarchical streamline bundles, a novel approach to simplifying and visualizing 3D flow fields defined on regular grids. By placing seeds and generating streamlines according to flow saliency, we produce a set of streamlines that captures important flow features near critical points without enforcing the dense seeding condition. We group spatially neighboring and geometrically similar streamlines to construct a hierarchy from which we extract streamline bundles at different levels of detail. Streamline bundles highlight multiscale flow features and patterns through clustered yet not cluttered display. This selective visualization strategy effectively reduces visual clutter while accentuating visual foci, and therefore is able to convey the desired insight into the flow data.",

      "abstractNote": "Software visualization encompasses the development and evaluation of methods for graphically representing different aspects of software, including its structure, its execution, and its evolution. Software visualization combines techniques from areas like software engineering, programming languages, data mining, computer graphics, information visualization and human-computer interaction. So far, there exist only anthologies and proceedings about software visualization. With this book, Stephan Diehl has written the first textbook on software visualization. As such it targets both students and teachers in computer science. Topics covered include static program visualization, algorithm animation, visual debugging, as well as the visualization of the evolution of software. The author's presentation emphasizes common principles and provides different examples mostly taken from seminal work. In addition, each chapter is followed by a list of exercises including both pen and paper exercises, as well as programming tasks. Although written mostly for graduate students, the book will also be a source for researchers in both academia and industry, as it will provide a broad and systematic overview of the area including many pointers to tools available today.",

      "abstractNote": "UML diagrams have become increasingly important in the engineering and reengineering processes for software systems. Of particular interest are UML class diagrams whose purpose is to display class hierarchies (generalizations), associations, aggregations, and compositions in one picture. The combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations poses a special challenge to a graph layout tool. Existing layout tools treat hierarchical and nonhierarchical relations either alike or as separate tasks in a two-phase process as in, e.g., [Seemann 1997]. We suggest a new approach for visualizing UML class diagrams leading to a balanced mixture of the following aesthetic criteria: Crossing minimization, bend minimization, uniform direction within each class hierarchy, no nesting of one class hierarchy within another, orthogonal layout, merging of multiple inheritance edges, and good edge labelling. We have realized our approach within the graph drawing library GoVisual. Experiments show the superiority to state-of-the-art and industrial standard layouts.",

Our information architecture was developed for juvenile justice and medical patient records, but is usable in other application domains such as personal resumes, financial histories, or customer support. Our model groups personal history events into aggregates that are contained in facets (e.g., doctor visits, hospitalizations, or lab tests). Crosslinks enable representation of arbitrary relationships across events and aggregates. Data attributes, such as severity, can be mapped by data administrators to visual attributes such as color and line thickness. End-users have powerful controls over the display contents, and they can modify the mapping to fit their tasks.",

      "abstractNote": "Software visual analytics (SVA) tools combine static program analysis and fact extraction with information visualization to support program comprehension. However, building efficient and effective SVA tools is highly challenging, as it involves extensive software development in program analysis, graphics, information visualization, and interaction. We present a SVA toolset for software maintenance, and detail two of its components which target software structure, metrics and code duplication. We illustrate the toolset’s usage for constructing software visualizations with examples in education, research, and industrial contexts. We discuss the design evolution from research prototypes to integrated, scalable, and easy-to-use products, and present several guidelines for the development of efficient and effective SVA solutions.",

This has shortcomings with respect to efficient space usage and makes mapping the effect of user input into one view into the other view difficult. We propose here a novel, space-efficient technique that ‘fuses ’ the two information spaces – structure and activity – in one view. We base our technique on the idea that user interaction should be simple, yet easy to understand and follow. We apply our technique, implemented in a prototype tool, for the understanding of software engineering datasets, namely static structure and execution traces of the Chromium web browser.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper deals with automating the drawing of subway maps. There are two features of schematic subway maps that make them different from drawings of other networks such as flow charts or organigrams. First, most schematic subway maps use not only horizontal and vertical lines, but also diagonals. This gives more flexibility in the layout process, but it also makes the problem provably hard. Second, a subway map represents a network whose components have geographic locations that are roughly known to the users of such a map. This knowledge must be respected during the search for a clear layout of the network. For the sake of visual clarity the underlying geography may be distorted, but it must not be given up, otherwise map users will be hopelessly confused. In this paper we first give a rather generally accepted list of rules that should be adhered to by a good subway map. Next we survey three recent methods for drawing subway maps, analyze their performance with respect to the above rules, and compare the resulting maps among each other and to official subway maps drawn by graphic designers. We then focus on one of the methods, which is based on mixed-integer linear programming, a widely-used global optimization technique. This method guarantees to find a drawing that fulfills a subset of the above-mentioned rules (if such a drawing exists) and optimizes a weighted sum of costs that correspond to the remaining rules. The method can draw even large subway networks such as the London Underground in an aesthetically pleasing manner, similar to maps made by professional graphic designers. If station labels are included in the optimization process, so far only medium-size networks can be drawn. Finally we give evidence why drawing good subway maps is difficult (even without labels).",

      "abstractNote": "Public transportation systems (PTSs) play an important role in modern cities, providing shared/massive transportation services that are essential for the general public. However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.",

We have implemented these visualization techniques in Flamingo, a software tool that can be used to explore Internet traffic flow data. Flamingo is able to process live Netflow data in real-time and present a set of interactive visualizations and associated manipulation tools that can help users in network data analysis. Flamingo is comprised of a server and a client component. The Flamingo server is responsible for receiving raw Netflow feeds from devices in the network that can sample traffic, and then sending processed information to the client for display. The Flamingo client receives data from the server and provides concise intuitive data visualizations, 3D space navigation, as well as filtering capabilities that can help the operator to extract or monitor specific information of interest. Flamingo also supports a playback mode which allows users to select specific historical Netflow data for visualization. We illustrate with the help of simple examples, based on traffic data from a busy Internet backbone router, how Flamingo can be used to perform network monitoring tasks as well as network security related data forensics",

      "abstractNote": "Today’s system administrators, burdened by rapidly increasing network activity, must quickly perceive the security state of their networks, but they often have only text-based tools to work with. These tools often provide no overview to help users grasp the big-picture. Our interviews with administrators have revealed that they need visualization tools; thus, we present VISUAL (Visual Information Security Utility for Administration Live), a network security visualization tool that allows users to see communication patterns between their home (or internal) networks and external hosts. VI-SUAL is part of our Network Eye security visualization architecture, also described in this paper. We have designed and tested a new computer security visualization that gives a quick overview of current and recent communication patterns in the monitored network to the users. Many tools can detect and show fan-out and fan-in, but VISUAL shows network events graphically, in context. Visualization helps users comprehend the intensity of network events more intuitively than text-based tools can. VI-SUAL provides insight for networks with up to 2,500 home hosts and 10,000 external hosts, shows the relative activity of hosts, displays them in a constant relative position, and reveals the ports and protocols used.

Much of this information can be represented by networks with nodes corresponding to objects and links representing their relationships. Node and link diagrams, although natural choices to display this class of data, are easily overwhelmed with too much information, becoming cluttered and visually confused. Three solutions help solve the information overload problem: (1) parameter focusing and dynamic interaction, (2) clever node positioning to show structure, and (3) 3D embeddings. Bell Laboratories' SeeNet, NicheWorks and SeeNet3D systems embody these techniques. The company has successfully exercised them to visualize data from several industrial-sized network data sets.",

It expresses the idea that common visualization techniques have been designed for use cases that are not supportive of security-related data, demanding novel techniques fine tuned for the purpose of thorough analysis. Significant amount of work has been published in this area, but little work has been done to study this emerging visualization discipline. We offer a comprehensive review of network security visualization and provide a taxonomy in the form of five use-case classes encompassing nearly all recent works in this area. We outline the incorporated visualization techniques and data sources and provide an informative table to display our findings. From the analysis of these systems, we examine issues and concerns regarding network security visualization and provide guidelines and directions for future researchers and visual system developers.",

Existing systems, however, simply visualize country-by-country statistics of attacks or hourly changes of attacks. Using these systems, it is difficult to understand the source of attack, the diffusion of the attack, or the relation between the target and the source of the attack. This paper described a method for visualizing cyber threats by using 2-dimensional matrix representation of IP addresses. The advantages of this method are that: (1) the logical distance of IP addresses is represented intuitively; (2) Internet address space is visualized economically; (3) macroscopic information (Internet level) and microscopic information (local level) are visualized simultaneously. By using this visualization framework, propagation of the Welchia worm and the Sasser.D worm are visualized.",

      "abstractNote": "When performing packet-level analysis in intrusion detection, analysts often lose sight of the big picture while examining these low-level details. In order to prevent this loss of context and augment the available tools for intrusion detection analysis tasks, we developed an information visualization tool, the time-based network traffic visualizer (TNV). TNV is grounded in an understanding of the work practices of intrusion detection analysts, particularly foregrounding the overarching importance of context and time in the process of intrusion detection analysis. The main visual component of TNV is a matrix showing network activity of hosts over time, with connections between hosts superimposed on the matrix, complemented by multiple, linked views showing port activity and the details of the raw packets. Providing low-level textual data in the context of a high-level, aggregated graphical display enables analysts to examine packet-level details within the larger context of activity. This combination has the potential to facilitate the intrusion detection analysis tasks and help novice analysts learn what constitutes normal on a particular network.",

      "abstractNote": "Network security is the complicated field of controlling access within a computer network. One of the difficulties in network security is detecting the presence, severity, and type of a network attack. Knowledge of such an attack is used to mitigate its damage and prevent such attacks from occurring in the future. We present a new visualization of a computer network for security purposes by approaching the problem from a service-oriented perspective. This approach involves a node graph visualization where each node is represented as a compound glyph, which gives details about the network activity for the specific node based upon its service usage. Furthermore, we visualize temporal activity using time slicing techniques in the compound glyph to give more details about the network and allow interactive controls for an administrator to actively monitor a network in order to react to security events quickly. Our resulting visualizations of networks successfully identified and described denial of service and compromised network attacks.",

      "abstractNote": "Modelling relationship between entities in real-world systems with a simple graph is a standard approach. However, reality is better embraced as several interdependent subsystems (or layers). Recently, the concept of a multilayer network model has emerged from the field of complex systems. This model can be applied to a wide range of real-world data sets. Examples of multilayer networks can be found in the domains of life sciences, sociology, digital humanities and more. Within the domain of graph visualization, there are many systems which visualize data sets having many characteristics of multilayer graphs. This report provides a state of the art and a structured analysis of contemporary multilayer network visualization, not only for researchers in visualization, but also for those who aim to visualize multilayer networks in the domain of complex systems, as well as those developing systems across application domains. We have explored the visualization literature to survey visualization techniques suitable for multilayer graph visualization, as well as tools, tasks and analytic techniques from within application domains. This report also identifies the outstanding challenges for multilayer graph visualization and suggests future research directions for addressing them.",

      "abstractNote": "Identiﬁcation and characterization of cancer subtypes are important areas of research that are based on the integrated analysis of multiple heterogeneous genomics datasets. Since there are no tools supporting this process, much of this work is done using ad-hoc scripts and static plots, which is inefﬁcient and limits visual exploration of the data. To address this, we have developed StratomeX, an integrative visualization tool that allows investigators to explore the relationships of candidate subtypes across multiple genomic data types such as gene expression, DNA methylation, or copy number data. StratomeX represents datasets as columns and subtypes as bricks in these columns. Ribbons between the columns connect bricks to show subtype relationships across datasets. Drill-down features enable detailed exploration. StratomeX provides insights into the functional and clinical implications of candidate subtypes by employing small multiples, which allow investigators to assess the effect of subtypes on molecular pathways or outcomes such as patient survival. As the conﬁguration of viewing parameters in such a multi-dataset, multi-view scenario is complex, we propose a meta visualization and conﬁguration interface for dataset dependencies and data-view relationships. StratomeX is developed in close collaboration with domain experts. We describe case studies that illustrate how investigators used the tool to explore subtypes in large datasets and demonstrate how they efﬁciently replicated ﬁndings from the literature and gained new insights into the data.",
