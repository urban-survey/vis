        Node Link Layouts

        <p> Node-link diagrams are the most common graphical representation
          of networks. In a node-link diagram, the nodes are drawn as
          point marks and the links as line/curve marks connecting the nodes.
          Node link layouts are the subject of their own field of study—graph
          drawing—and countless algorithms for node-link layouts have been
          developed [BETT98]. Schulz and Schumann [SS06] distinguish between
          free layouts, where the node layout is not restricted, an example
          of which is the force-directed placement; styled layouts, where
          the node positions are determined by a predefined scheme, such as
          a grid, or a radial layout; and fixed layouts where the position of the
          node is determined by an attribute, such as latitude and longitude
          on a map. In fixed layouts, the only degree of freedom is conferred
          to the drawing of the edges connecting the fixed nodes.

          Tabular layouts encompass approaches where nodes and/or links
          are represented as columns and/or rows of a table. The most well
          known of these approaches is the adjacency matrix, but this category
          also includes Quilts and BioFabric.
          A beneficial property of all tabular layouts with respect to multivariate
          networks analysis is that nodes, and in some cases edges, are
          in dedicated rows or columns, which can also be used to visualize
          attributes.

        Implicit Layouts

          Implicit hierarchical layouts are techniques for visualizing trees
          that rely on node positioning to encode edges. Well-known examples
          are TreeMaps [JS91, vWvdW99], SunBursts [AH98, SZ00],
          or Icicle Plots [KL83], but many variations are possible [SHS11].
          These layouts excel at visualizing a numerical node attribute as
          node size, and an additional node attribute as color, but are usually
          not amenable to encode multiple attributes simultaneously. Since
          edges are only implicitly encoded, edge attributes cannot be shown.

          We distinguish between two types of implicit hierarchical layouts:
          those that show the whole tree, i.e., the inner nodes and the
          leaves, and those that show only the leaves of the tree.

          View operations combine existing techniques into coordinated
          views, a technique commonly referred to as Multiple Coordinated
          Views (MCVs). These approaches use separate,
          dedicated views for the attributes and the topology. Common
          examples are combinations of node-link diagrams with multidimensional
          data visualization techniques or providing a detail view for individual nodes.
