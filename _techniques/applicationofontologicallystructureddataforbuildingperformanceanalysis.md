abstract_note: "Ontologies are developed and deployed to enhance knowledge and data exchange in a specific field or domain. For instance, building industry benefits from well-structured ontologies such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) [6] or green building XML [4] that drive Building Information Modeling software (BIM). In this context, efforts in building performance specification and assessment can also benefit from well-structured ontologies and data schemas. Toward this end, a recently introduced building performance data ontology attempts to identify, categorize, and capture the complexities of building related performance data and its attributes. The present contribution describes a process whereby building-related measured or simulated raw data is "ontologized" toward subsequent utilization in various building performance assessment applications."
