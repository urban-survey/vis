abstract_note: "Abstract             Visualizations of 3D cadastral information incorporating both intrinsically spatial and non-spatial information are examined here. The design of a visualization prototype is linked to real-case 3D property information. In an interview with domain experts, the functional and visual features of the prototype are assessed. The choice of rendering attributes was identified as an important aspect for further analysis. A computational approach to systematic assessment of the consequences of different graphical design choices is proposed. This approach incorporates a colour similarity metric, visual saliency maps, and k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) classification to estimate risks of confusing or overlooking relevant elements in a visualization. The results indicate that transparency is not an independent visual variable, as it affects the apparent colour of 3D objects and makes them inherently more difficult to distinguish. Transparency also influences visual saliency of objects in a scene. The proposed analytic approach was useful for visualization design and revealed that the conscious use of graphical attributes, like combinations of colour, transparency, and line styles, can improve saliency of objects in a 3D scene."
