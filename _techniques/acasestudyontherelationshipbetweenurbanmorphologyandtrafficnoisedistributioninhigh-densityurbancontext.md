abstract_note: "Noise pollution is one of the key issues that may have significant impact to the physiological comfort and psychological wellbeing of urban dwellers and to urban environmental quality in general in the planning of liveable city to achieve urban sustainability. Applying validated numerical noise mapping technology, a case study of 30 high-density urban residential neighborhoods in Singapore were conducted utilizing an integrated and automated workflow for simulation, analysis and visualization. The results revealed the significant impacts of several key urban planning and architectural geometric parameters on a variety of performance indicators quantifying the traffic noise levels as simulated for outdoor open spaces and building fa√ßade. The research findings highlight the need to develop methods and technology to allow reliable and efficient evaluation of urban aural performance in the early stage of planning and design when building typology and urban morphology play a much decisive role in affecting a variety of environmental qualities."
