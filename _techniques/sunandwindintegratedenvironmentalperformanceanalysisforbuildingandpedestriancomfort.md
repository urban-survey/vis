abstract_note: "Solar access and pedestrian wind are important factors for the design of comfortable dwellings and livable urban areas. At the same time they influence the shape and image of cities. Daylight is the most appreciated source of building interiors illumination. Urban wind can significantly increase the discomfort of pedestrians for its mechanical action around buildings. In Estonia the daylight standard regulates access to sun light. Different pedestrian wind comfort criteria exist. This paper presents a research work which analyzes the performance of direct solar access according the Estonian daylight standard and pedestrian wind comfort according the Lawson criteria of 27 building cluster variations in the city of Tallinn. A method which integrates different building and urban performance analysis is developed. Results show different optimal patterns for each environmental performance, though significant trade-offs are found, and critical periods of the year for pedestrian wind comfort."
