abstract_note: "The potential of solar energy encourages research into new applications of this technology. Access to renewable energy is an important element of modern urban policies aimed at sustainable development and the energy security of residents but also limits energy production from conventional sources due to the pollution associated with them. More and more often, projects of new urban infrastructure facilities include integrated photovoltaic panels. Assessing solar potential is an important step when planning the layout of solar panels, and the increasing number of high-rise buildings increases shaded areas, sometimes even for most of the day. Therefore, a detailed shading analysis can be important for city decision makers, investors and local communities. The results of the 3D spatial analysis presented in the article can be used to optimize the location and analyse the profitability of photovoltaic installations in a city. The aim of the project was to evaluate the effectiveness of photovoltaic panels on the shelters of public transport bus/tram stops. The proposed methodology for calculating the solar potential and shading may be a valuable extension of existing solutions in the field of planning installation power and the location of individual panels. The research methodology can be used in the future to support decision making and spatial planning related to the placement of photovoltaic panels. It was tested for bus shelters located in the centre of Warsaw (Poland). The results can also be used to assess the impact of alternatives to newly designed high-rise buildings and to plan the provision of photovoltaic panels to other city infrastructure facilities."
