abstract_note: "Leveraging Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatiotemporal visualization and analysis of simulated UBEM datasets and real-world data simultaneously can assist in identifying opportunities, as well as potential barriers, to energy efficient and climate adaptation strategies. However, current GIS-based models that support interactive exploration of adaptation strategies and future scenarios are scarce and do not easily incorporate building energy use data for visual analysis over time. This paper describes a workflow to integrate simulated building energy consumption data associated with variable energy efficiency scenarios within a GIS platform for interactive spatiotemporal visualization to support climate adaptation decision-making. The contribution of the work presented is in the ability to selectively view and analyze simulated building energy performance data layered with other real-world geospatial data through an automated feedback loop between an UBEM and ArcGIS. An interactive interface is designed in ArcGIS to enable users to explore building performance scenarios spatially and over time. Using a downtown neighborhood in Syracuse, New York, USA, as a case study, preliminary results demonstrate how the workflow provides insight into existing energy use issues and potential for implementing strategies such as energy load shifting or building retrofits. A discussion includes opportunities as well as challenges to the workflow in facilitating understanding of urban energy model outputs by multiple stakeholders in evaluating potential energy efficient strategies."
