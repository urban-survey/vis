abstract_note: "Measurement and simulation are two main methods to determine natural ventilation rates in a building. By contrast, the simulation method is widely used in engineering due to its simplicity and convenience. In the practical application of airflow simulation software such as CONTAMW, there exist many simplifications for the actual conditions of simulated buildings. This study focuses on three of the commonly used simplifications and analyses their effects on the simulation results. In addition, for rigorousness, tracer gas decay method is used to verify the reliability of CONTAMW simulation. The conclusions of this study can be used as guidance for airflow simulation software such as CONTAMW."
